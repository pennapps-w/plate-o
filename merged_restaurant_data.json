My wife's eggs were runny and her other food was barely warm.  I ordered a \"skillet,\" which I love at other breakfast spots.  What they brought me instead was a skillet-shaped ceramic dish.  The eggs were cold and runny, and all they did was take it back and reheat it - they didn't even re-fire the order.  Take a trip to Anna Marie's, the Limerick Diner or even Bob Evans - way better food, experience, and service - overall, more bang for your buck.",

The online ordering system worked nicely, though they don't accept Paypal (which I prefer for credit card security reasons) or Amex (which I prefer in general). They're a pan-Asia place, with Chinese, Japanese, and Thai dishes (this is not a good sign; it's like a diner with a menu that reads like a book -- how can you do that many things well? Answer: Likely you can't). I ordered both sashimi as well as a common Chinese dish (which I specified extra spicy). The sashimi was excellent! Very fresh and tasty. The Chinese dish had plenty of fresh vegetables, which is good. But it was  bland: not only didn't it have much flavor, but it also was lacking heat. Mind you, this was a dish listed with a pepper next to it on the menu, and I specified \"extra spicy\" in the order. And it was what I call \"gloppy\" -- typical Americanized Chinese food with a lot of oil. A good dish should have a thinner, tastier sauce. Also, I ordered the \"large\" portion, but it came with a rather small container of rice. And rather than putting the rice in a nice enviro-friendly  typical Chinese cardboard takeout box, the rice arrived in a Styrofoam container. My search for tasty Chinese food in Phoenixville shall continue. The nearest remains Margret Quo's Mandarin in Malvern / Frazer, though I doubt they deliver to Phoenixville (and you have to remember to ask for \"no MSG.\").",

Sure there are, but at 11:30pm, call or drive around and see if you can order from one.  Chances are they're closed.  That's what happened to me late one Sunday after working on cars all day at my friend's garage.  We thought it would be simple, those backlit yellow and red letter signs never go off.  The shining beacon in the urban night sky for wontons, dutchies, and chips.  Nope.\n\nIn fact, I had lived about two miles away when I first realized this.  So I made that two mile drive every time I wanted Chinese take-out in the final hours of the day.  One thing I should mention is that they do achieve wok hei, at least with the fried rice.  Wok hei, or \"breath of the wok\", is that sort of smokey burning flavor attained only from very high heat and the carbon steel of a wok.  Also I'm not sure if it was part of my conscious decision or sheer luck, because I now live less than a block away from China Star.  I can see it from my window as I write this.  It's 11:37pm on a Monday night, and yes, it's still open.",

I thought it was just my drink but all my friends had weird drinks as well. I asked my other friends to try it and they said it wasn't just me and something was completely off. The boba in the pearl milk tea was not soft or even sweet, it tasted nothing like their signature tapioca. I contacted them through mrwishbencity about this. They opened my picture of the receipt and never replied. It's been four whole days and I'm really upset about this. Today, 11/9/19, I bought the tiger shark and it's nothing as advertised. My friend who works at the Chinatown Mr. Wish said this is nothing like the tiger shark. When she drank it, she said it tastes like regular milk and the boba is so hard. It's as if they didn't make the boba the way they were supposed to make it.",

China Wok was also the first chinese take out restaurant to be established in Swedesboro and Logan Township.

I dunno, but somehow I doubt it. \n\nNothing wrong with this location just as there's nothing inherently WRONG with this ice cream, but none of the flavors I tried made me want to keep buying it. The first one I ever tried was the Brambleberry Crisp. Did not even finish the pint. The 'crisp' part was annoying to eat, very hard in comparison to the other ingredients and I did not find the fruit swirl to be especially tasty.\n\nThe Darkest Chocolate, which I bought at Whole Foods, was fine but I will continue buying Haagen Dazs chocolate over this. I think it tastes better.\n\nPistachio Macaron, also purchased at Whole Foods, was too sweet and there was a dearth of pistachios. Again, I'll take Haagen Daz Pistachio over this, as it is absolutely loaded with large pistachio pieces, the flavor base is mild and it doesn't put me into a sugar coma. Talenti Pistachio gelato is a second runner up to Haagen Daz's for a full nut experience.\n\nSure, it's nice that Jeni Bauer has been around since the late 1990, started out small and is now nationwide. Kudos to an enterprising, hard working woman. Even though I don't eat ice cream very often, $12 a pint is an extravagance for me, especially as none of the flavors appeal in the least.\n\nTaste is highly subjective and clearly Ms. Bauer has an enormous fan base that doesn't include me.",

Thankfully, my stupidity was mitigated by Jeni's explosive expansion into the Philadelphia region with two locations - Fishtown and Center City. I decided to make the trip with some friends from across town to get to Fishtown and try the ice cream I so longed for. Filled with unique flavors, each type had the rich, deliciousness all dairy ice cream SHOULD have. For every minute that passed, my mouth was watering at the idea of being in one of the greatest places to exist on this earth.\n\nWhen I got there, it was the same, simple design that greets you with a warm feeling of \"hey, you're home now. Jeni's is here for you\". I quickly got my favorites - Gooey Butter cake, Blueberry Crisp, and Honey Vanilla bean. When put together, they make an ultimate combo that slaps ur tastebuds yelling \"what have you been doing eating those nasty tubs of ice cream from Acme?\" As soon as I sat down with the waffle pieces and the scoops of ice cream, I dived into the winter wonderland. Even the thought of the taste salivates my mind, and this ice cream is hard to beat in its consistency anywhere else. But within minutes, the three scoops were gone. Then I remembered, this place has kinda mid portions for the price - no wonder I bought those tubs of Ben and Jerrys.\n\nDespite the portions, this magical place gives you a surreal experience of ice cream flavors that will hopefully finish off the hefty meal you grab or satisfy that sweet tooth that came in with.",

Nice store design with frontage of Frankford Ave, we appreciate the modern design in the neighborhood. 2 stars though because the price is outrageous. I purchased two kids sized cups. To be clear, that is literally two child sized small scoops, two scoops total! Not a couple scoops or a full bowl.  Total $10. Wow. Like really?  We love to support local business here in the neighborhood, and regularly spend a premium to do so and have for years.  Jeni's is however NOT a true local business. They have national distribution and locations all over the US, so it feels somehow off to have a national company charging those kind of prices when Igloo and Weckerlys are equally as good, arguably better (that's subjective) with better price points for what you get. Van Leeuwans soon to follow curious where they will stand.  With national scale and distribution, price points can and should theoretically be held artificially lower. Anyway, enjoy either way.

The cashier was polite and welcoming. \nThe Baja bowl was delicious. It had a nice mix of ingredients. My daughter was pleased that a healthy  Keto meal was available. My other daughter had the chicken salad sandwich with chicken noodle soup. (Can you tell she likes  chicken) Both the Sammie \nand soup were tasty! I had 1/2 Fuji Apple salad and vegetable soup. The soup was filled with veggies and perfect for a cold day. The salad was good. I didn't realize it came with chicken I actually wanted more greens. I went back to the server. She was so nice and apologetic even though it wasn't her fault. She happily gave me more greens. \nThe tea here is Republic of Tea brand so it's good. My daughters were happy with their coffee drinks.",

The food was fairly decent which is why this is a 2 star as opposed to a 1 star review.  My issue is that the business REFUSES to post pricing on their menus.  I just looked @ Panera's website and there is STILL no prices whatever on their menus.  People are on fixed budgets and have fixed means of income for crying out loud?!  I would therefore be @ the mercy of the honesty of the then co-worker as to how much I would be charged - thankfully said person is honest.  If I remember correctly when she called in the orders she was not apprised of the prices until she went over to pick up the stuff - she's much more comfortable about driving on Street Road than I am or I'd go over to check it out myself.  I am surprised no one mentioned this as you would think there would be local or state legislation requiring pricing be placed on menus - printed or online.  This BTW is the ONLY food business I ever encountered this with.  Even today (1/23/17) there is NO pricing on their online menu; they tout having a transparent menu - without pricing as far as I'm concerned it is NOT transparent enough!  I neither live nor work near one of their locations currently and with NO pricing posted I definitely will not go out of my way to patronize these locations.",

I could see a few customers inside, & the lady employee, & I tried waving at them to get someone to open the front door, as I cannot open doors without assistance, & everyone inside either laughed & shook  their heads, or pretended not to hear me. Some junkie finally opened the door & the laughing customers kept laughing & making comments. I asked if my being handicapped amuses them & they said it's hilarious because I was causing a scene. I wasn't originally causing a scene. I explained that there's no side door & I'm not struggling to get stuck in the grass or in middle of the road & get hit by a car. Employee was also laughing her @$$ off & I said to let me out. Door was locked & she laughed & said she was too busy to let me out. \nHer excuse for the front door being locked was because she's working alone & doesn't want to get robbed. Nobody can park out front, only in back, so, if she was going to get robbed, getaway car would be out back. There's nowhere for a robber to run away out front, except right into the 5 way intersection directly out front. Horrible things were said to me by the customers (ask me)\nI'm never going back there.

This treat is justifiable: The mango water ice actually tastes like mangoes, not overly concentrated mango syrup typically paired with sticky rice found at greasy chopsticks joints.\n\nIf you want to indulge your sophisticated side, try vanilla water ice with coffee ice cream. It tastes much better than any of that frappuccino shit you get at _______. This concoction tastes like somebody smashed together equal parts sugar and vanilla and dumped it over frozen creamy coffee. You'll feel mature eating it, but you'll probably get brain freeze. Irony. Enjoy it.\n\n Plain Water Ice:\nAmaretto. It's pretty amazing that amaretto water ice tastes like amaretto cream without any actual cream in the water...ice.

So Mike was like lets just eat at Good Burger, they have a pretty good burger.\nSo we did.  And it was Good.  Seriously though, the service is out of this world frustrating.  I don't mind if people can't speak English in this country...so long as I don't have to deal with talking to them in a situation where they need to be talking to people as 80% of their job.  I tried ordering a 5.5 Burger with The Works (sans Tomato), and she said that it came to 9.00 or whatever.  But the register said double that amount and I kept trying to tell her I wasn't ordering two of them.  But she couldn't comprehend.  So eventually the girl next to her took over the register and expedited the process.  \nAnyways I got my food about ten minutes later, which is 5 minutes less than my friends took...and he ordered the same thing as me...and he ordered before me.  What a world we live in.\nSo the Burger itself was pretty darn perfect.  Juicy, full of toppings, but the meat stood out and wasn't overwhelmed by them.  The fries were also a delicious surprise and they came with some of that dipping sauce that seems to be all the rage now in Philly everywhere you go that serves Pommes Frittes.  Was it better than Five Guys?  It was probably a little less greasy, but all in all a similar taste and quality I would say.  I'd definitely go again if the mood should strike me for a reasonably priced Burger that will take a few minutes longer than McDonalds...and Rouge is packed because its the first day the weather is nice in weeks and people come to the city en masse.  Who can blame them though?",

Also looking at the menu and seeing I was going to pay 6+ dollars for just a burger didn't sit to well with my broke ass self. I had to try it though so I ordered my burger well done and it was done in a few minutes. The burger was pretty tasty and had a little kick which I liked but nothing overwhelmingly spectacular. The music was turned down to a low murr so I hummed along with the pop music that I am embarrassed to know the words to. \nI will still stick with Five Guys when I am in the mood for a chest tightening burger.",

When I was tasked with sending 40+ last-minute quality baskets to our guests in a foreign (to me) city, I was SO happy to find Touch of Class. However, as good as the website looked, I was a little hesitant to believe the hype only because I have been let down before. Everything about this place blew my mind. The snacks are not only things that you would actually want to eat, most of them are roasted BY the owners! Renee (co-owner) sat on the phone with me while I hand-picked the items for our baskets and gave me her biased, yet well versed opinions. I actually had fun \"designing\" these baskets with her when normally I absolutely loathe the process of sorting through crappy unappetizing snacks.\nWhen I went to pick the baskets up from the store, I was totally blown away by the selection of treats available in-store. They have any kind of nut, chocolate, fruit, snack combo imaginable. After sampling I also found them to be quality and delicious, not an easy feat. The presentation of the baskets was beautiful - I could see that the staff really put time into making them, bows and all. I didn't mention that I gave them less than 3 days to design, stock and assemble.. and they were completed with a smile (and a hug!). The prices were what I asked without sacraficing the content.\nI will definitely return to Touch of Class and have already recommended them to a friend. You cannot go wrong with this place!",

Unlike other chains (and other Subways for that matter) where there seems to be constant turnover of employees. The same few Sandwich \"Artists\" have been there from almost the beginning. This is refreshing and it's like seeing old friends when you walk into places that are able to retain their valuable employees. \n\nSubway seems to be trying to stay current with their customer base in the heavy promotion of the $5 sub deal. They have also added flatbeards, apples, etc as more health conscience alternatives to the traditional sandwich. And even though they did away with the stamps and cards for a free 6\" sandwich every 9th time -- they now offer an electronic card that accumulates points that are good towards free sandwiches, drinks, cookies, etc. \n\nYou know what you are going to get walking into subway but the franchise in Perkasie is different and that is due to its employees ....  and that's the bottom line.",

I have the bread scooped out and the chicken breast toasted. They used to keep the chicken in a warmer, but that recently changed and they now keep it with the cold meats. I also get lettuce, tomato, spinach and cucumbers with salt & pepper and ranch dressing. It always hits the spot!\n\nJust recently I switched it up and ordered the chicken on honey oat but with spinach, tomatoes, hot peppers, pickles, salt & pepper with chipotle sauce.\n\nThey also have soups. My personal favorite is the brown rice with chicken.\n\nDon't forget a point card. For every $1 you spend, you get a point and it adds up pretty quickly. I get a free foot long sandwich at least once a month, just by hitting $75 points.",

You can go to a million bubble tea locations as many times as you choose and consistently receive boba that is not quite right, or constantly different in quality. But this is not an issue at Kung Fu Tea. The bubbles are always perfectly made and consistently made. No matter when you go or how often you frequent the place, you can count on receiving perfectly cooked, delicious boba in your bubble tea.

A lot of you young 'uns may not remember this, but back in the 1980s women's magazines in America would have these startlingly inauthentic \"Chinese\" recipes. You'd see recipes like \"Chinese pineapple surprise\" which was boneless chicken, pineapple, ketchup, and just a hint of soy sauce for that \"unique Asian flavor.\" \n\nI remember my mom cooking those sorts of things. And the food at this place tastes just like that! You don't taste garlic or rice wine or pepper or sesame oil. Just plain ol' chicken and soy sauce and rice. It's not terrible but definitely not worth a detour. Cheap as heck, though: my two-entree meal was like $7. (See pic.) Fellow Gen X and older folks, relive the American Chinese food of the 70s and 80s right here in sunny Delaware!",

I was a little wary at first because I thought it'd be an express kind of thing (low quality, get in get out kinda deal). Pleasantly surprised though!!!

Due to the lack of traffic in this mall, you shouldn't have to wait long.  There is a wraparound bar (minus alcohol) for you to sit and eat.\n\nClean, fast, courteous. \n\nI tried the fruit smoothie assuming it was fresh fruit and ice..it is not! Still was ok..tried the green apple but not what I expected. \n\nThey have numerous rolls,standard and special, and plenty of beverages to choose from including bubble tea \n\nThe Philadelphia roll was fresh and so yummy,  looking forward to trying the miso soup",

When I walked into the store there was no one at the counter and when she came she said nothing to me but looked at me, I just thought well maybe she is having a bad day and continued to tell her my order. I told her \"light oil\" and instead she put started to put mayo I told her \"No i'm sorry I said oil.\" I absolutely hate mayo and she tried to argue with me and said \"You said light mayo\" she then took her glove inside out and started to wipe the mayo off of my sandwich it had to be the most unsanitary thing I have ever seen. I grabbed a bag of chips and put them on the counter she rang me up without asking did I want the which I did want the one with the sandwich, chips and drink she then rolled her eyes and just told me the total. I had to grab my own fountain cup and than there were no straws! I asked her for a straw and her response was her shaking her head! I was furious but I only had a 30 min lunch break, I have never been treated so rudely by someone before.",

        "text": "Even for a Popeye's, this place is pretty bad.  Its not filthy, but it's definitely not clean.  The food is below average for a Popeye's and the service is friendly on the surface though has its edges (more on that in a moment).  \nI don't expect white glove clean at any fast food joint, but this one made me feel like I was at Market East Station rather than in the suburbs.  The only available table has the crumb and grease remnants of former occupants and the seat had a black gummy substance on it which has yet to be identified.\nI ordered chicken nuggets, a mistake I realized almost immediately.  The one or two times a year I get Popeye's, I should stick with the fried chicken or the chicken fingers at a minimum.  At least with the fingers, you get some of that vascular traffic jamming crunchy action.  So half the nuggets were actually pretty good, with the crunchy batter.  The other half seemed breaded and microwaved.  They held their heat like microwaved nuggets and were much mushier than the other half of the batch.  I'm guessing they had about five ready when I asked for a 9 piece so they then micro'd the balance.  Just a guess but there was a distinct difference .  On the window of this \"restaurant\" was a sign that said \"try our signature dipping sauces!\"  So when my food came up, they guy didn't even ask me if I wanted any sauce.  I asked for some and instead of asking me which one I'd like, he chose one (Spicy and Sweet or something like that) and said \"this is the best one\".  Well, I quickly discovered that he and I have very different tastes and went back to get something I might actually enjoy.  I asked for the Mardi Gras mustard and he was visibly annoyed.  Whether he was annoyed that I was costing him an extra sauce or that I disagreed with him was not clear.  But he didn't like my request and didn't care if I knew it.  Worse is that he appeared to be the owner and manager.  Bad example.  The Mardi Gras mustard was ok (heavy horseradish).  The food was just boring considering it will cost me an hour off the end of my life.  The biscuit was a hockey puck.  Total BS.  You can't even get that right?\nI've already spent more time than I planned on a review of a fast food place but I also want to note that the door was broken and kept flying wide open.  Since it was very cold outside, this was a problem.  I got up to close it once but refused to do it twice.  I ate fast and left.  I probably won't be back.  Not even once a year.",

My mom happened to saw the staff add the syrup into the last juice (no ice) before sealing it. When we received our order we told the cashier that we don't want ours with added sugar, she went behind the curtain to ask, came back and told us sugar wasn't added into the juices. I then stated that \"my mother saw\" it. The nice cashier went back in again to confirm the story. Another female staff (the one who made our drinks) came out and claimed that sugar was only added to the order with no ice (which doesn't make sense one bit). She took back the drink with no ice and made us a new order. Sorry for the rant, but lesson to take away is always ask beforehand when ordering sugar cane juice anywhere.",

I drink bubble tea and go to all sorts of dessert places but this is more like bubble tea to the max. They give you so much great stuff in their che from taro, tapiocas, jellies, and coconut and more. Also their teas are great, I would recommend the jasmine or Thai or even be more adventurous and try Vietnamese and tropical flavors. Been here like a dozen times and will keep on coming as long as they keep on serving. Would love for them to expand into center city and beyond.",

The store had just a couple of customers, and that was surprising being it was during the height of lunch hour. The gentleman behind the counter greeted me with, Hello, it's been a long time. He was the owner he had introduced himself years ago when I was a regular customer. I ordered my food a Spicy Italian on Herbs and Cheese roll and had requested my sauce be placed on the bread. There were some new toppings, so I was checking them out and not paying attention to the construction of my sub. The man asked sauce on top; I replied with \"Did you put a good bit on the roll,\" I order it on the roll to help prevent it from dripping on my clothes. He made an angry face and proceeded to lift the contents off the roll and show me, I asked if there was a problem and he went on to reprimand me for having asked for a little on the bread, I may have used the word little but was only wanting to know if he put any on the bread because I wasn't paying attention and so that I knew there was sauce on it. There was no one in line behind me, yet so I was taken back by his giving me attitude. I took my sub to go, it was good but I have always been respectful to this guy and even tolerated his bad talking Subway corporation in the past because \"they don't support the owners just have demands on them\" I had given him frequent receipt reviews all positive and even did a yelp review years ago that was also very positive. A woman was at the register and was very kind, thanking me for coming in. When I exited the store, it was the last time I will ever go there. Maybe this explains how on a summer day during the lunch rush near a theme park, the store was not busy? After posting my briefly of displeasure with on the receipt survey I received an email from the owner, it was a boilerplate message saying he shared my feedback with his team to improve customer service. That was even more of an insult and showed how much he doesn't care about his customers. When I exited the store, it was the last time I would be there.\u200b",

He even called me back to verify what I wanted once he received the online order.  The pizza was actually delivered 5 minutes before the time requested, so I was happy about that.  But the pizza was delivered room temperature.  A co-worker told me that they used here once before and it was not hot when delivered, but I tried it one more time.  There is not a lot of delivery choices in KoP.  But I will not be going back unless I hear they made a change.  The menu is also very limited with choices of toppings.  They offer a veggie pizza but do not have broccoli or spinach.   I am only giving them the 2 stars because of the person I spoke with, I hope they find a new delivery service and then advertise that on their web site when the do.",

The hubs and I have been here a long, long time ago for the sushi and even before the place expanded, but don't remember if the sushi was good or not. \n\nWe love the hibachi here. Hibachi is always pricey (~$25), but so good and makes for great leftovers.  Husband gets the filet mignon with scallops and I get filet mignon with salmon.  Sometimes we get a shrimp or two from the chef. Hibachi comes with a small soup and salad. \n\nSushi is a hit or miss, as are the appetizers.  We tend to stick with just the good ol' hibachi and always look forward to the \"yum yum\" sauce to dip everything in - is that weird?  The \"yum yum\" sauce here tastes better than other hibachi places we have been to.  If you like it as much as us, you'll be excited to know that the salad comes with \"yum yum\" sauce as well. \n\nSo happy to see that Mt. Fuji has expanded in this not-so-poppin' plaza and seems to have very good business.  Definitely one of the few places in our dinner rotation! \n\nP.S. Our baby daughter drools every time we go here, hehe.  She will be thrilled to eat with us when she gets older!",

Asking the people at the register is useless as they always seem to find themselves too busy to assist customers who need help, and going to the other side where the kitchen is is also useless as these employees are too busy preparing food to provide any assistance to lost customers.\n\nThe food is less than average for a Panera Bread. As mentioned above the kitchen is hectic and probably a living hell given the way everyone steps over each other and tries to do their own thing without any kind of cohesion. The managers/supervisors look and sound mean, doesn't look like employees are working together so much as trying to survive the impossible traffic this location receives every day under the poor management.\n\n\nAll in all, skip this location. There are plenty of better eateries accessible around this Panera Bread. Don't give anymore of your hard earned money to this underperforming, poorly managed corporate chain that could easily be replaced with another.",

I would have liked my oatmeal to have been a little more moist, but it wasn't too bad. The orange scone and caramel latte were delicious. Downside for my wife is that there aren't many gluten-free options for breakfast. Even the souffl\u00e9, which would normally be a GF option is not here, so she had to stick with the oatmeal and fresh cut fruit. Decor inside was nice with plenty of seating and staff was friendly.",

Every time there was something wrong with a customer's order or something happened to it, the restaurant would always make a new one whether it was their fault or not. Terrible customer service!

All of the food is very fresh (that can be a problem at other paneras!). The side bread is also very fresh- not that rock-hard, day old stuff.\n\nDepending on who's working, they can be a little lazy. My most recent experience with the Avocado Chicken Cobb Salad was one giant hunk of avocado. Don't get me wrong- I love avocado- but they did nothing to chop it into smaller pieces, which is then a bit difficult to do in the small carry-out containers.\n\nI'd go here again as it's fast, and depending if they change the laziness at points, I'll update my review. Overall, though, the speed of this Panera is amazing.",

I'm not into chicken pho, but their broth is good that I can consume without the meat. I wasn't a big fan with their steamed chicken though. I for sure had better elsewhere. Banh Uot was probably my favorite. I had to share with the BF. Their fermented beef was interesting. Had a different taste to the palate than what I'm used too.\n\nI wouldn't mind returning to try other dishes. Maybe the ratings would change, but all in all I'm mutual and give it a solid 3 stars. Still kind of new, so hoping this establishment would progress and grow.",

However, they had a slightly off flavor, possibly suggesting that the oil they were fried in wasn't as fresh as it could have been.",

Definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for some good authentic Vietnamese food in the south Philadelphia area!!",

        "text": "Joes is weird....let me explain.\n\nI recently got a new job in the area, so I was out scouting new places to eat and happened upon Joes, so I decided to stop in and get some Italian. The first thing that I noticed when I walked in was the latino radio station playing as the 100% latino staff worked the ovens and register. Not a problem, its just that Joes does not read \"Italian\" in ANY way. Like I said, that doesn't bother me in the slightest; if the food is good, I don't care if clowns cook it, it was just a little weird. \n\nWhat DID take me aback is the next thing; are people supposed to be behind the counter?! As I sat, waiting for my food to be ready, a lady got up, walked behind the counter and refilled her soda and went back to her seat. \"Ooooookay....she must work here or something, or know the owners....\" As I sat, no less than FOUR MORE PEOPLE just walked in, and walked behind the counter. They refilled their drinks, got ice, picked up and touched things, etc. One guy even finished his food, walked behind the counter, GOT CHANGE FOR A 10 FROM THE REGISTER, and left through the back door! And he had like a USPS uniform on, so he absolutely didn't work there. It was SO WEIRD! Is that just like a thing they do here? I'm confused.\n\nAbout the food, I had pizza the night before, so I went with chicken fingers at Joes. The fries were perfect, and the chicken was cooked well enough, even though they were less \"fingers\" and more \"flat pounded chicken.\" The fingers weren't really seasoned and I asked for honey mustard to eat them with. The honey mustard was TERRIBLE. It tasted like old wax or something, and I'm almost positive there was no \"mustard\" in it. It was like, mayonnaise, honey and tortured souls. Yuck. \n\nChicken fingers, fries, drinks and side of regret flavored like honey mustard came to about $10.",

I ordered lunch take out and was left really wanting. \n\nI ordered the wonton soup and general tso chicken. My order was ready very shortly after I arrived and was hot and packed nicely. \n\nI got home and dug into the soup, the wantons were very good and I was hopeful for the rest of my meal. However, I should have stopped with the soup. There was nothing appealing about my chicken dish at all. The rice was flavorless and the broccoli tasted frozen microwaved. The chicken had nice color but what sauce was on the chicken was the consistency of peanut butter and was extremely bland.",

The wings vs tenders had a different taste , both of which are amazing . The wings didn't come with a sauce and they didn't need any ! The prices are super reasonable and the restaurant itself was super clean ! They have a nice range of sizes depending on if your dining for one or for a group . Check out this checked ! You won't be disappointed:)",

I said ok, I'll try it but I specifically asked if they put peanuts on it, he said no, but just in case I asked him to please make sure there's no peanuts. Many Vietnamese dishes love to top their dishes with peanuts. Hubby got his dish and he said it was average. Few minutes after he got his, I got my mango salad, with peanuts . They took it back and made another one. The mango had a nice crunch to it. After about my 3rd piece I realize, there was no chicken. I asked my hubby if I heard it wrong and he agreed that the waiter did mention there was chicken in it. I didn't want to send it back again. I just ate the mango dish and left it at that. Between the mango salad (which is quite a small dish) and his pork chop rice with viet coffee, it cost close to $30. Maybe the waiter didn't familiarize all the dishes yet. But I can give it another try for their hot pot next time :) as for their dishes, in my opinion, it tasted like any viet dish I've had around.",

I had to let the chain know that something was off with their ingredients today and to be more careful with their future customers ... and nothing. All they said is perhaps you ate elsewhere. Sadly, I didn't. All I had today was a mini American from here at 11 am and ran home from work at 5 with a super crampy and queasy stomach ... here I am shivering and stuck in my bathroom with horrendous food poisoning three hours after getting home.

        "text": "We are always on the lookout for a quality sandwich place near our home. This would have been really convenient, and we'd have been overjoyed to like this place. Unfortunately, we were really disappointed.\n\nWe got regular size hoagies that look nothing like the photo they show on their website. They said one sandwich would \"feed 2 people\" for almost $10 with tax. What 2 people do you know who will eat 3.5\" of sandwich for a meal and be satisfied? Not two grown-adult non-anorexic Philadelphians. Was this a mistake by a new employee or something?\n\nThis place is new, and I try to pad reviews for newer places even when I don't dig them, but in this case, I could not finish eating my meal, so I can't ignore that.\n\nJust under $19 for two 7\" hoagies that were Wawa quality, from roll, to meats, to mayo.\n\nIn fairness, I am not a chain hoagie person. If you like places like Primo's, Subway or Wawa, then by all means, help yourself to Jersey Mike's. But if you are more of a mom-n-pop authentic Philly sandwich type of person, who has come to know the quality meats, toppings and rolls that our area has to offer, then I don't think the quality at this place will stand up to what you're used to.\n\nWe had a turkey hoagie and an Italian, both were very low-quality meats. Also, the veggies were tasteless and the roll was terrible. It was definitely the kind of roll you'd get at Subway, not at all something that tasted fresh from a Philly bakery.\n\nMy turkey was the same rubbery-looking stuff they give you at Wawa. I could not finish. Wasted half the sandwich, which was only 7 measly inches to begin with.\n\nThe Italian was no better. Not much flavor, all lower-quality ingredients. Thinly-packed, with not much in it at all. Again, very disappointing.\n\nThey put a lot of hype into their marketing and advertising, and have fancy logo-printed wax paper and bags. The bag and wax paper presentation was like Burger King. Please, save the money on the logos and put it into better quality ingredients. To us, you just branded something we will never eat again, and couldn't finish. Wasted money. Had to go out again to get takeout elsewhere just to finish dinner.\n\nSorry Jersey Mike's, we heard great things about you on Philly.com and thought you'd be different from Primo's. I guess a franchise, is a franchise, is a franchise. It's just not for us.",

I did some googling and found out this is a very southern thing and that Krispy Krunchy Chicken is kind of a big deal down there. I was shocked to find one so close. I never noticed it because I don't use the Exxon station it operates out of.\n\nThey have stand inside and a menu full of combos and options. The chicken looked damn good. The sides I was a little iffy about so I got the $5.00 tenders special. I didn't know how many tenders I was getting but it came with fries and a biscuit. The nice man put my meal together and off I went with pretty stuffed little platter. Don't hesitate if you're craving fried chicken and see this stand at your gas station.",

The dishes such as the general tso's chicken, etc is cooked very well with a nice crisp to it without over doing it. \nThey deliver within a wide distance and are very quick with their deliveries.

I didn't know they had online ordering and it would have benefitted us as I inquired about the $1 pancake on the menu and she said it was $4 and I said no thanks as I just wanted to see but they still sent it to us, but it was work it (scallion pancakes with dipping sauce... very good, but flimsy which is fine if you dont mind it.  The wonton soup was very good, excellent broth, very good wontons.  The egg rolls were solid.  Almost an hour had passed by the time I got to my container of chicken lo mein and pork fried rice and it was still very hot, which really surprised me and it was quite good.  We have a ton of leftovers and can't wait to eat them.  Overall food was between good and very good and the 15 min turn time in the snow was what cemented a 4 star rating.

        "text": "I've been going here on and off for the past 6 years. There has been some major and minor changes and I stuck with Miraku through thick and thin. Overall, I go back to Miraku because their sushi is one of the freshest I've ever tasted. I am not a big fan of maki(rolls) but Miraku's specialty makis are really good. Especially the double spicy salmon roll(YUM), the snow storm roll(torched yellow tail with spicy tuna, double YUM), and the lobster roll(with uni sauce? PERFECTO). \n\nThe kitchen food(hot foo) is sometimes hit or miss but when it's right, it's SO right. They change the presentation and ingredients often. I consider it to be a positive thing because they're constantly striving to be better. \n\nThe servers aren't your average snobby city servers - they all seem to be either in high school or college. It's always been like that. Though I enjoy the full proper service when dining out, I feel like I can relax here and the servers are really cute running around and doing what they can do best to make your dinner more memorable. \n\nPS. it's a BYOB so bring your favorite sake and ask them to heat it up. You'll have perfectly warm/hot sake to go with delicious sushi. Also, I found that Miraku is cheaper when it comes to the toros - O toro or Chu toro. \n\nPSS. The wooden decor is really pretty. They also have private rooms for the big parties... of 6 or more.",

We told them it was our first time, and they said they use all fresh fruit and everything they have is refreshing. \n\nI got a mango smoothie, which only comes in a medium size and it had small chunks of frozen mango. The medium was a good size but it was $4.75, which is a bit expensive. \n\nMy sister got the mango tea with fresh pulp in the large size. She asked for boba pearls which was 75\u00a2 extra for the topping, so hers ended up being $6.25 but the large is a good size. My sister says it was very fresh. \n\nInside the actual store front it was a good size, not too big and not too small. It had some tables and chairs to wait or sit and eat in. I was able to pay with my card, and tip on their iPad and text the receipt to my phone easy peasy. Overall I would go back again,   especially because the location was close to my house.

I've also tried \"Extra Hot\", which is really good as well. They wouldn't let me get homicide unless I had tried it before... which seems like a catch 22. I'm not sure it even exists. \n\nThe two guys who work there are really nice and friendly. I'm never waiting very long, and the TV is usually tuned in to the news or whatever sports game is on.\n\nThey have two tables,  but I don't think you're meant to eat in (it is wings TO GO after all). \n\nOverall my favorite wings place in the area. And they're right across the parking lot from PIzza City and a liquor store, which is really convenient.",

Tsos Bean Curds because she said it was good, n boy was she right! The tofu was nice n crisp outside, and not mushy. The sauce was sweet n spicy, just right. The food was piping hot. My nephew ate honey chicken with pork fried rice, but i couldn't see the pork, LOL. He said the chicken was really good, n his eggroll likewise. I also had hot n sour soup, which was delicious as not many places can make it good. I ordered a scallion pancake which my SIS liked, but i thought was just a Lil too doughy for me, but dipping sauce was good. SIS n i both had springrolls, n she devoured hers, n i will eat mine with my leftovers. N this establishment happens to have brown rice, which I prefer over white rice. Overall, I was pleased n impressed, as initial impression was...I sure hope their food is good. I will definitely be back, n i added them to yelp so others can enjoy their food too!!!!",

I am particular about the crust too and expect that to be flavorful, crisp, and just the right amount of crunch on the top. I wasn't planning on purchasing a pumpkin pie for thanksgiving, but as I walked down the aisle of my local organic market, I saw this gem of a pumpkin pie and it was calling my name. Imagine my delight when I opened and bit into my first slice only to realize this was to become my favorite pumpkin pie - ever. Seriously, it was that good! For $14.95 (which I didn't think is unreasonable for a good quality pie), this pie was worth every penny! I need another please, stat!!!",

They have two girls that work there that are friendly and polite.  Every other girl they have working there is just down right rude.  One girl even tries to put less meat on your sandwich if she thinks you are not looking.  They act like it is an inconvenience if you have to ask them what kind of soup they have but you always have to ask because they never update the board that tells you.  I, unfortunatly, am stuck going to this location if I want subway for lunch because I only have a short lunch break and this is the only location that I am able to make it to in my time frame.  If you are able to avoid this subway I would definatly reccomend finding a different location.",

The food was do good and I loved the lunch box they served it in. Also the cookie was so tasty. I have to admit that subway has upped their game and food was even better than panera and Corner bakery were we usually cater from in our blue bell office.",

They will hold the line to count off the slices, I guess they care more to save a portion of a cent on a slice of salami.\n\nOnce a teenage guy served me there, he was much better at being speedy and did not care to split occasional piece of salami in two.",

Apparently, this location has changed hands since 2014 because this location bakes their bread at 10am in the morning and sells it all day without baking more.  When I got there at 4:38pm asked for wheat bread and wanted the roll scooped.  When guy scooped bread it began to fall apart but if roll were fresh it would not have done so.  I questioned the guy and he told me they only bake bread at 10am.  The bread sits inside of the oven which is off.  The ends of the bread were hard.  Stay away from this location as the lunch meat also looked old.  I know there are better quality Subway's you will just have to find one.",

My meal started with a sweet potato/jalape\u00f1o soup, followed by orange duck, and finished with an Argentinian Chocolate Cake accompanied with a Caf\u00e9 con Leche. This dinner stop did lived up to its reviews. The restaurant is a cute quaint establishment. Their menu has numerous traditional choices, vegetarian dishes, and gluten free options. The soup was hearty, the entree was well executed, to include the potato mash and grilled vegetables. This chocolate cake slice was massive and pretty unique. It had layered puff pasty and dulce de leche. I'm kind of picky with my coffee and this caf\u00e9 con leche was spot on. So sad I'm in town for only a few days, I would love to go back and try other item from their menu. Good Job Caf\u00e9 con Leche!",

And thanks to Yelp, I discovered their was a location not far from our hotel! \n\nI ordered a medium Italian sub with rosemary oregano bread. I didn't have it \"the mike's way\" (lettuce, tomato, mayo). I had lettuce, tomato, pickles, banana peppers, oil, vinegar, oregano and for some reason I asked for parmesan cheese. Still can't figure that out. \n\nThe sub was just as yummy as I remember. I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie which was the bomb dot com and so soft! I ate it the next morning and it didn't need to be warmed up, it was still soft!\n\nI gave 4 stars because it's a bit pricey.

When they got to my order, there were 2 associates working behind the counter. The male associate made one of my sandwiches, then before he made my second one he started a big online order of sandwiches. Unbelievable. So I had to stand there and wait until he made the online order before he got to my second sandwich. And this guy was super slow. Then, finally, he started with the second sandwich. A pen was on the counter and touched my bread! I couldn't believe that. That is beyond dirty. Then I witnessed another associate pick up that pen, use it WITH GLOVES ON, THEN MADE ANOTHER PERSON'S SANDWICH WITH THE SAME GLOVES ON AFTER TOUCHING THE PEN! Again, unbelievable. When I asked for toppings on the side to go, the male associate started packing them, but right in the middle of it a phone rang. He answered the phone WITH GLOVES ON, then DIPPED HIS HANDS BACK INTO THE TOPPINGS WITH THOSE SAME GLOVES ON!! Yuck!!!! So unsanitary!! Needless to say, I threw away those toppings on the side. I spent $20 and will never go back. What a horrible experience. Stay away from this place.",

I am a huge fan of composed salads and this did not let me down. My grand mother had the Mediterranean sandwich and my grand father had a cup of french onion soup and a half a tuna sandwich. Both of them cleaned their plates. Which was a surprise to me because they are very hard to please when it comes to food. They both keep kosher (as much as possible when eating out) and both have set diets. And also my grandfather is just a pain in the butt most of them time with how he likes to eat. \n\nI would have rated them better but the girl who took care of us seemed annoyed when my grandparents asked questions about the food to make sure that things were seasoned to where they could eat it. I understand it was lunch time and it was busy but seriously the girl knew what she signed up for when taking that job. If you can not handle a customer service position then don't work it. She got the order right which was good but her \"really I have to do this\" attitude had to go.\n\nThe wifi did not really work. And my cellphone reception was terrible. I get some anxiety when my son is in school and I do not have cell service. Definitely something they would look into. \n\nI think the next time I go there it will be for a to go order.",

Temple's China House on Cecil B. is THE Chinese take-out joint.\n\nI'm sure you, the consumer, are wondering what makes this particular Chinese restaurant--this particular China House--so special. Do they offer anything astoundingly different from the others? No. They just do it really well.\n\nChina House is convenient and fast. The General Tso's chicken, most people's go-to, is crispy and well-sauced. The hot and sour soup, my go-to as a starter or entree usually, is appropriately sour and hot, and very chunky. Fried dumplings are delicious. My good friend and former roommate swears by their vegetarian options, particularly the General Tso's Tofu.\n\nAs an added bonus, they'll often have SEPTA one-day passes for a dollar off, and even better, they now sell bottles of that ineffable rooster-branded hot sauce, Sriracha. If you live at, or near, Temple, China House ought to be your go-to. If only they were open as late as some of those lesser Chinese places, they could truly be top dog.",

This is the first place my partner and I ate at when viewing our would-be apartment and I'm pretty convinced it's the reason we signed the lease! After 2 years of devoted patron-ism, it's time I write a proper review. The food here is awesome, the beer is always nice, and the guys behind the bar make a great cocktail.\nMenu favorites: \n-Hummus, always served with three different types from goats cheese to scallion to pepper      \nand plenty enough flatbread for dipping. \n-Nachos are tasty, massive, and totally enough for 2, even 3. \n-The daily soups are always on point. \n- Steak salad is FANTASTIC. \n-I would skip over the turkey burger and opt for the beef burger which is super tasty. \n-The chicken salad sandwich is a definite win and the house salad served with is so fresh with a house made ( I think white balsamic vinegar) dressing. \n-We've only ordered off the brunch menu once but the chicken and waffles stick out in my memory as being a great order. \nWhat I love about Pete's is that the staff sticks around. For as long as we've been going I haven't seen much change over, if any. They're great at their job and they seem to enjoy it. I've for sure been turned off by quite a few bars in Philly lately that seem to only hire the \"hipster\" (I hate using that word, but it just fits) type that can barely make time to take your order because they're entertaining friends at the end of the bar. Pete's is the total opposite; welcoming, friendly, and just the right amount of attentive. \nAlso, Pete's is very linked in with Old Swede's Church across the road, and frequently team up for gigs and benefits. That little corner of Queen's Village really does feel like one big family. \nA side note: parking around Pete's is generally actually super easy. I'm hesitant to give away the secret, seeing as we frequent those spaces, but parking in front of the church on the cobblestone or under 95 is the way to go. \nSee you there!",

        "text": "This Popeye's Chicken shack sits in a long commercial strip on Trenton Road, Morrisville, Pa.  It is a standard franchise for the company.  The space is clean and attractive, with a well hidden drive thru component around to the back.  \n\nI went in the other evening for a light dinner and to help nourish my life long Southern Fried Chicken addiction. I just can't seem to get enough.  Love the crunch and the hot oil burning my fingers. Love the spicy coat.  Love the way it pulls away from the bone with a little coaxing. \n\nThese days, fried chicken is offered on the more sophisticated menus, and even for breakfast with waffles for those who just want max carb load.  (I'm not there yet.)  But, just because someone with a chef's hat and culinary school degree puts a batch together doesn't mean it is any better than the cheaper, faster, mass produced variety.  In fact, there is a school of thought that fried chicken is like singing the blues.  You know; \"You have to suffer if you want to sing the blues...\" Those hands playing six string acoustic or even Lucille, bring something to the experience that can be felt deep in the soul.  \n\nChicken be that way, too.  The true fried chicken artists, like the best Delta or Hills Blues guitarists and singers, are rooted in a culture and existential angst that generates the creative instinct leading to emotionally charged performances.  Those same forces are at work with fried chicken.  In the hands of a master, the chicken becomes an extension of his life, the same way a great song emerges from that primordial place deep in the heart.\n\nThis 2 piece box o' chicken may not have been epic, but it was solid and even inspired this review.  So, even though we weren't sitting in Muscle Shoals, Alabama in a roadside chicken house, there was enough there to let the imagination run wild.\n\nJust wish they actually played that music at Popeye's, rather than the current soundtrack.",

I guess it better than getting nasty dry chicken lol. I make sure that I never get food from here unless I have the time to wait.",

Reviews for this Popeyes location were good so took a detour on the way home to pick up the food order.\n\nPrior reviews mentioned that this was a clean location and this is very apparent when one steps into this joint. The interiors are super clean and well maintained (including the rest rooms). \n\nThe chicken tenders were freshly prepared and the last time we had memorably good ones from a fast food spot was at a service area at 5AM (was the first batch). The side of blackened ranch was zesty and paired well with the crispy and spicy tenders. Hit the sweet spot for us and left us feeling so satisfied. Would definitely come back here in the future. Very friendly customer service.",

I actually wasn't a huge plain fish person when I started eating here, I liked crunchy/spicy specialty rolls more, but the quality of Hikari's fish is so good that I've converted! And yes, to the point of other reviewers, it is expensive, but the food is actually worth it. The service is also excellent. The woman who is our usual waitress, Ina, is incredibly sweet and attentive. It's a chill place to go with friends or even solo with a book and some wine  Highly recommend this spot!!",
