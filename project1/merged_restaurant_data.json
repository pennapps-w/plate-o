The wrap had honey mustard even though my sister said \"no honey mustard\". But I don't know if I can blame the cook or the waitress. \n\nOur waitress wasn't the greatest. She was a little slow and when we asked her what the soup of the day was she forgot to come back and tell us. When she did remember she couldn't remember what the soup was. Today it was cream or something, maybe crab or maybe corn and something vegetable. I'm not kidding that is what she said. Now as I am allergic to seafood they are very different soups! \n\nThe prices there are pretty reasonable. For the three of us it was about 30 bucks. I will admit I have been there for breakfast and that was much better.",

Soaked up two napkins worth of water from the egg white omelette and the \"seasonal fruit\" was some gray pineapple and another fruit I couldn't quite identify (maybe pear?) I sent it back, because I could make a more appetizing omelette at home and not have to spend $7.99. Chose not to try anything else from the menu after seeing their standard for a breakfast. Husband got eggs benedict which was fine, but nothing special. \n\n\nOverall, staff was very understanding and immediately took the omelette off of the check without question. 4 stars for the staff, but the food quality is just poor and we won't be back.",

I ordered 4 of the same drinks and it's ridiculous that I have to wait 30 minutes...????????????\n\nAlso, it is very unsanitary for long hair to be worn down while making bubble tea or any sort of food establishment. Please tie up your hair- I've seen you touch your hair with your hands and proceed to touch the drinks, i do not want to find hair in my drink.\n\nI ended up going to the cashier and told her that it's been over 30 minutes for our drinks and they told me they ran out of milk tea..?? How are you going to run a bubble tea place and run out of milk tea? AND they ran out of bubbles. \n\nHighly disappointed in this establishment and location.

I thought it was just my drink but all my friends had weird drinks as well. I asked my other friends to try it and they said it wasn't just me and something was completely off. The boba in the pearl milk tea was not soft or even sweet, it tasted nothing like their signature tapioca. I contacted them through mrwishbencity about this. They opened my picture of the receipt and never replied. It's been four whole days and I'm really upset about this. Today, 11/9/19, I bought the tiger shark and it's nothing as advertised. My friend who works at the Chinatown Mr. Wish said this is nothing like the tiger shark. When she drank it, she said it tastes like regular milk and the boba is so hard. It's as if they didn't make the boba the way they were supposed to make it.",

I hurried in to grab lunch in between my shift at the hospital. And he was kind enough to put my meal on the house to thank the healthcare workers during this time with COVID. So thank you for making us feel appreciated when everyone else is quarantined at home. We essential workers are still front line trying to fight this.",

There is plenty of tables and booths more than any other location I have ever been to. They also have a kiosk ( which I totally missed walking in ) but you can skip the lines and order it all by yourself. I also liked how clean and how they were on top of cleaning/wiping down the tables. \n\nI ordered my go to pick two, I love that you can mix and create your own combo. As always it was delicious. Napa Almond Chicken Salad & the mac & cheese. I had always heard how good it was and wanted to try it for myself. The only problem is that its not diet friendly. I also liked they had 6 fresh brewed teas and lemonades. \n\nI will definitely make it a point to frequent this location more! \n\nDon't forget to sign up for their rewards program, after so many visits you can earn a free pastry or coffee or beverage.",

Luckily I was smart and ordered a coffee while I waited. \nThe deal with this place if you have never been to a duck donuts is that every doughnut is customizable and made to order. So you can either choose a doughnut variety they make themselves or you can create your own. There were so many good choices and I decided to place my fate in the hands of the duck. I opted to get half a dozen and chose an assortment of donuts. My favorite easily being the maple bacon which literally tasted like a good morning breakfast. I would definitely make time to check this place out , especially if your a die hard doughnut fan like myself.

The service was friendly.  The room was small, with only two tables for those who want to eat their pizza just out of the oven when it is at its prime. So, this is basically a take out joint. \n\nWe wanted a quick bite to tide us over until dinner. A slice apiece and sharing the drink was our intention. \n\nI requested that the reheat be \"well done,\" in order to bring the ingredients back to life after sitting on display. \n\nWhat we received were slices that were not hot in the center where the cheese was thickest. That was likely due to the excessive amount of cheese piled onto the pie, out of proportion to the tomato sauce which seemed sparingly used. The result was pizza that could not be picked up by the crust because it was too heavy on the topside.  The taste was weak because of the cheese/sauce imbalance, and perhaps the quality of the cheese and sauce themselves.  The crust would have been improved with a little salt added to the dough.  \n\nNot an impressive effort by Pizza Land.",

I am 100% sure this was just regular milk tea. I felt deceived. Aside from this, the order had the toppings, sugar and ice level that I requested. The bubble tea tasted like a standard milk tea, nothing to write home about. The boba was a tad sweeter than I would have liked. \n\nOverall, this was just a very unsatisfying trip and drink.

You can go to a million bubble tea locations as many times as you choose and consistently receive boba that is not quite right, or constantly different in quality. But this is not an issue at Kung Fu Tea. The bubbles are always perfectly made and consistently made. No matter when you go or how often you frequent the place, you can count on receiving perfectly cooked, delicious boba in your bubble tea.

Still was ok..tried the green apple but not what I expected. \n\nThey have numerous rolls,standard and special, and plenty of beverages to choose from including bubble tea \n\nThe Philadelphia roll was fresh and so yummy,  looking forward to trying the miso soup",

For a little extra you can make it a combo and add chips and a fountain drink. I like having lunch here because you don't leave with that glutenous feeling after having a sandwich unlike at some other places. Services is great and after coming here a few times one of the employees even remembered me and my co-workers orders.",

Only about 4 long tables, but it's never been busy enough when I've been there that I couldn't grab a table. Other ones make you pay for the sauces, but I forgot when I ordered and asked for some after and got them free. Self-serve drink dispensers, clean bathrooms. Waited about 10 mins for the noms, but at least it was a fresh batch (biscuits are #mmgood). My one complaint is that every time I've been here the sunlight shines bright through the windows with a glare that settles onto your face if you sit and eat as minorly inconvenient as that may be. Needless to say, I'll be returning whenever that irresistible Popeyes chicken calls my name once more. #cravingfood",

It was not as great as I expected, but it was not terrible either. This store was located somewhere I'd probably called like a mini-Viet area since everything was Viet. There was actually a moderate line when I got there and there's a lot on the menu. Of course, gotta try the che. It was okay. Unique. I enjoyed the pandan jelly and the coconut milk combo, but.. It was just not something I would want to go out of the way to return to. It was a good experience, but not something I'd go for compared to my love for other things. Definitely worth trying though cuz the pandan jelly is quite good.",

I came in with 2 coupons.  Usually most places will run two separate charges so using 2 coupons isn't a big deal.  I ordered my sandwiches and went to checkout.  The owner refused to honor the second coupon and gave me an attitude.  Honestly, the customer service in this location sucks.  Owner also did not give me the corporate napkins too, which could possibly be a violation of their franchise agreement.  Corporate, please take note.",

        "text": "I came in to the Subway that I used to frequent for lunch on Tuesday, Aug 20, 12:38 pm. The restaurant was clean, and the food neatly on display appeared fresh. The store had just a couple of customers, and that was surprising being it was during the height of lunch hour. The gentleman behind the counter greeted me with, Hello, it's been a long time. He was the owner he had introduced himself years ago when I was a regular customer. I ordered my food a Spicy Italian on Herbs and Cheese roll and had requested my sauce be placed on the bread. There were some new toppings, so I was checking them out and not paying attention to the construction of my sub. The man asked sauce on top; I replied with \"Did you put a good bit on the roll,\" I order it on the roll to help prevent it from dripping on my clothes. He made an angry face and proceeded to lift the contents off the roll and show me, I asked if there was a problem and he went on to reprimand me for having asked for a little on the bread, I may have used the word little but was only wanting to know if he put any on the bread because I wasn't paying attention and so that I knew there was sauce on it. There was no one in line behind me, yet so I was taken back by his giving me attitude. I took my sub to go, it was good but I have always been respectful to this guy and even tolerated his bad talking Subway corporation in the past because \"they don't support the owners just have demands on them\" I had given him frequent receipt reviews all positive and even did a yelp review years ago that was also very positive. A woman was at the register and was very kind, thanking me for coming in. When I exited the store, it was the last time I will ever go there. Maybe this explains how on a summer day during the lunch rush near a theme park, the store was not busy? After posting my briefly of displeasure with on the receipt survey I received an email from the owner, it was a boilerplate message saying he shared my feedback with his team to improve customer service. That was even more of an insult and showed how much he doesn't care about his customers. When I exited the store, it was the last time I would be there.\u200b",

Prices are also rather fantastic...I don't recall anyhing under 10 bucks but if it were, it's probably worth it.\n\nI got the breakfast combo of crab cake, 2 eggs, homefries and toast- all for 7 bucks and it was over-the-top filling.\n\nThis place is smackdab in Norristown so perhaps if you have jury duty or just around town in need of a quick bite you should definitely stroll in.\n\nThe interior is small and the set up is cute- counter seating and several tables around. The owners are a lovely Korean couple who are friendly as heck and beyond accomodating.\n\nI had an awesome dining experience here and if they started serving korean cusine, I'd be in there every day- I even told them so!",

Unfortunately, a recent change in wait staff was made which would cause us to look elsewhere now for breakfast. Experienced an unfriendly waitress who showed zero customer service abilities. We had about 5 things wrong with our order, some requiring food sent back and others requiring to just cancel items. And I hate sending food back! Needed to ask multiple times for the same thing before receiving it. I can take inaccuracies from a new employee who might be learning, but no tolerance for attitude. I suspect this waitress won't last long at all and would return with another staff change, as the food remains decent for the price. The owners seem nice and do there best to keep things flowing when busy. If ordering for pick up, I give it 5 stars.",

It is subway so the sandwiches are the same but service is key. It is also the cleanest subway I have ever been in. As I was leaving the gentleman working was on his knees cleaning the legs of the table that people rest their feet on. They wipe down everything and are a great franchise representative of Subway corporation. If you are out shopping and want to grab an inexpensive bite to eat I highly recommend this location.",

He said he didnt remember...then when i pressed a little more, he decided to get me out of his face quicker by telling me.\nNever asked me if i wanted it toasted...but said \"What else? (on the sandwich)\" i had to ask that he not continue to veggies but toast.\nSnatched my card etc.\nListen..rule of thumb...meanness is an illness, you should have called out of work.\n\n3 stars because the lady who was there, i heard how she interacted with other customers and she was polite",

The local clipper magazine that just came had a front page advertisement that listed \"Fresh Lobster\", so I figured I'd give it another try as it's hard to mess up lobster and it's been nine months since our Lobsterfest in Maine.  I had a craving that needed to be satisfied!\n\nUnfortunately King Buffet has not improved since our last visit.  The food quality was very hit or miss between selections, with the typical assortment of items that you can find at almost any Chinese buffet.  Freshness seemed to be an issue with some dishes.  Case in point: the melted butter for the crab legs was very stale and tasted like it was blended with cooking oil.  I couldn't use it.  \n\nBut most disappointing for me was that there was no lobster despite the recent advertisement.  The staff cheerily told me that the seafood company had no lobster, so sorry.  \n\nWhen I was paying my bill, the friendly checkout girl told me that dinner prices are higher on the weekends due to additional menu selections.  When I inquired what the additional menu selections were she said \"frog legs and mussels.  And sometimes we have lobster\"  I can accept that a business may have supply issues that occasionally prevent the delivery of an item.  But to both advertise and charge for that item and not deliver will keep me from going back.",

The owner is so nice and friendly ! \n\nThere are two tables so keep that in mind if you are coming to sit down & eat.

The pork fried dumplings were so fried they were basically burnt. The egg drop soup was a dark yellow color and had an odd lemony detergent taste, I didn't even finish that. And their chef special \"lovers delight\" which is supposed to be shredded beef and chicken with peppers mushrooms and other veggies and a special sauce, turned out to be old peppers a mushroom and a few pieces of shredded chicken and beef in a sauce that tastes like all the other sauces. Very disappointing probably will not be returning. They got one star because the egg roll was good.",

The shrimp fried rice was tasteless. Over all spent $20 and wish I hadn't. Will not be ordering or taking out anything from this place. Such a shame because the staff was so pleasant.",

I noticed a new staff, so I wonder if the ownership has changed. \n\nRegardless, a friend of ours recommended that we try this place out... and we were surprised about how fantastic this place is. The pho is delicious (just as good as the old Pho Hoa before it went down hill) and Pho Saigon is very new and clean. Sometimes, cleanliness can be an issue at Asian restaurants, so I am delighted that this place is kept very clean. \n\nMy husband and I have been making a little trip out of it. We go to Pho Saigon for dinner and then drive over to the Monster Pets to look at puppies... He's some how able to drag me out of the store without buying a pup. \n\nOverall, I give this place 4 stars for the best Pho in Philly and for cleanliness. It's also located in a shopping center with free parking, so that's also a nice little perk as well.",

Asking the people at the register is useless as they always seem to find themselves too busy to assist customers who need help, and going to the other side where the kitchen is is also useless as these employees are too busy preparing food to provide any assistance to lost customers.\n\nThe food is less than average for a Panera Bread. As mentioned above the kitchen is hectic and probably a living hell given the way everyone steps over each other and tries to do their own thing without any kind of cohesion. The managers/supervisors look and sound mean, doesn't look like employees are working together so much as trying to survive the impossible traffic this location receives every day under the poor management.\n\n\nAll in all, skip this location. There are plenty of better eateries accessible around this Panera Bread. Don't give anymore of your hard earned money to this underperforming, poorly managed corporate chain that could easily be replaced with another.",

I ordered my lunch as usual, now it was delivered but it was missing the main part the SOUP. Which isn't a big deal i thought, well apparently after speaking with \"Summer\" was told that they do not deliver nor do they give refunds. I asked to speak to a manager AARON hoping i could actually get my lunch. Aaron was very rude and condescending. He did not apologize and tried to shift the blame on the delivery service door dash. I spend a lot of money eating there and this is the last time i will EVER support this location. After about 20 minutes of holding passing me back and forth btw summer and this manger Aaron They issued me a refund of 2 dollars for the missing soup. Disgraceful! They should have refunded the whole bill amount or try to fix the situation. Which they refused to deliver my soup, so i had to leave work and go get food some where else. So much for loyal customers, loyalty is not something Panera specializes in.  Very very disappointed",

They gave me a sample of their chickpeas and it was delicious. I eventually went with the chicken and rice meal, a samosa, and my husband got a lamb kabob with salad and a side is tabouli salad. My meal was great. I loved everything about it and the portion size was enough for two so I definitely had leftovers. The samosa was flavorful. I wasn't crazy about the lamb but that's probably because I loved my chicken way more! The tabouli (got a small) was huge - a but dry but delicious when I mixed it in my rice. The service, food, and price point makes me really hope this place stays around",

Love the popcorn chicken and the honey milk tea; altho the sauce for the pop corn chicken was too little and the rice to avocado ratio for the avocado kani was very little avocado filling and a bit more on the rice side. It still taste good tho. Would definitely come back again.",

But for the first timer, this is a good representation of what pho should taste like. \n\nGet the well done steak if it's your first time. The more acclimated you get the braver you will become. The veggies are always bright and fresh (bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, slice jalape\u00f1o). \n\nThis restaurant is a bit cleaner than those in the area. Good luck finding parking though if you're looking to make a weekend visit. The restaurant does have a lot of space so bring the family. \n\nYes, there are better pho restaurants in the shopping complex. But if its your first time, then eat here. It will make a good first impression and you'll want to try pho again. \n\nI've got the formula...",

I haven't explored most of the pho options in the city, but compared to all of the pho I've had in my life, it wasn't anything special.\n\nWe ordered the banh uot cha lua with nem (folded rice noodles/crepes with Viet cold cuts), pho dac biet, and bun mam. Banh uot was solid, though to be fair, there's not much cooking involved. The pho was missing some depth to its flavor and the broth could have been a bit clearer. I was also disappointed that there wasn't any tripe in the pho either. The bun mam was flavorful but a bit greasy with a thick layer of oil on top.\n\nPortions are good though and service is nice.

So I walk in anyway, and there I stood. Nobody came. So I seated myself. A woman appears with a menu and a glass of water... A hello would've been nice.. But I'm not here for pleasantries and casual chit chat... So I exhaled and looked over the menu.. \nBack comes the alleged hostess and asked me what I would like... Oh! You can speak... I was about to try out my broken sign language skills... If that didn't work, I would've channeled my inner 5 year old and simply pointed at the menu...\nI give this woman my order, and this broad decides to interrogate me... \"Have you ever had this before\"?? As if I shouldn't order it if I had never had it before... This was the line of questioning I really needed the time I ordered a side of duck/goose feet inside Oregon Market because I saw everyone else ordering it. It had to be good, right?? It was f'n disgusting....\nWhere was I...? So I looked at her for about ten seconds and calmly repeated my order and off she goes... The optimist in me was hoping that the slick question she asked meant that I was in for an epic meal... It was aight. \nCheck time... After winning roughly a trillion coins on a slots machine game on my phone, there still was no bill, although I could see the hostess sitting at the register, possibly playing the same exciting game that I was. The interest got the best of me. So I wandered over to the register to hopefully see what she was playing and pay for my meal. \nLong story short, the only parts of my meal that wasn't subpar was the bottled condiments and the glass of water.",

This restaurant couldn't do that.\n\nI don't have good memories of their pho...so I thought why not give it another shot. Maybe they've changed their recipes or made improvements since I last came. Nope. But I made sure to order a few items so that I'm not reflecting on that one dish that one time I came.\n\nSo here's what I got: their special pho dac biet, broken rice Combo, and rice with steamed chicken (Leg). A big reason why food declines in flavor is when shortcuts are taken to streamline. And I think that's what's the food tasted like.\n\nThe pho failed in many dimensions. The soup was just bone broth and lacked any type of other seasonings. The protein was chewy and bland. The pho noodles were overcooked. Cue the bad flashbacks.\n\nThe rice combo had mushy grilled pork (mushy, not tender), oversalted shredded pork (which was mostly pork skin), an overdone omelet...and their dipping sauce (nuoc cham) was very vinegary. \n\nTheir steamed chicken dish (similar to Hainan chicken except eaten with a ginger dipping sauce instead of soy cause) is a specialty item that is supposed to make them stand out because it's not often found on menus at other Vietnamese restaurants. What I consider a successful dish is dependent on the tenderness of the chicken and the flavor of the dipping sauce. Sadly, Pho Ha Saigon did meet those conditions. Here's why their dish was so lackluster: the chicken was leathery meaning it was either overcooked or prepared ahead of time and their ginger sauce had texture and flavor issues (possibly due to using minced ginger instead of ginger julienne and their nuoc cham was not so good to start).\n\nGiven that there are better options, I sadly won't be visiting again.",

There's no reason why his dish should be served when I'm almost done finishing up my bowl. That's a good 20 some minute difference. Tables around were getting their food just fine but we had to remind the waiters two times that my brother didn't get his plate yet. \n\nSo yes. A star was dropped due to the service.",

I felt like I was eating chewy imitation crab. Not buttery at all like it's supposed to be, and the roll was sub par. Soft is one thing, but soggy is a total turn off. My sister's avocado chicken bacon sandwich was supposed to be toasted. It was on yet again another soft piece of white bread. Can't go wrong with the bacon cheddar soup. That's about the only good thing I got out of this location, and the only reason this review got a second star out of me.",

However, after a show at the People's Light and Theatre In Malvern, I came across this Jersey Mike's on the ride home. \n\nI walked in and was greeted by the sight of a large restaurant filled with tables, beach pictures on the walls and two TVs. \n\nI decided to get the Jersey Mike's Combo meal, which came with a sandwich, chips and a fountain drink. I ended up getting the Famous Roast Beef and Provolone on the Parmesan bread. The sandwich was made perfectly. The roast beef was juicy, but thinly cut while the provolone cheese had a nice, mild taste and was very fresh. I also got some tomatoes and oregano on top, which brought the whole sandwich together. I also loved the flavorful of the hearty Parmesan bread. \n\nThey also had a great array of lays chips, which came the with the combo meal. I ended up getting the baked Lay's barbecue chips.\n\nAlso, the staff here was very nice and friendly. I especially liked how they gave me time to order, cut the roast beef perfectly and recommended the combo meal to me. They also were great in putting together the perfect ratio of toppings. The prices here were not too bad either. Unfortunately, they forgot to give me a cup for my fountain drink, which was part of my combo meal.\n\nAltogether, this Jersey Mike's Subs serves great food with friendly staff!",

I lived in the area since 2008 and I would eat from here all the time if I didn't feel like driving to Norristown for a lot more food for a better price. I didn't mind paying more. This store have went down hill a little since owners changed. I think a new cook have came into play over the past year. The food is just not the same anymore. I was not happy the last 3 times I came here and I switched to something new. But now I am completely done. The shrimp and broccoli used to be very good with nice size shrimp. The broccoli is on the hard side and the shrimp is slimy. Yuck. After ordering this two different times, I gave up. Shrimp egg foo young always been the best here. Now the egg is mushy and soft. Major turn off. They do have the best beef on a stick but for $6 plus tax, I think the beef should be almost the size of the stick it's on like most Chinese stores. Its about 2-3 inches long. Rip off. The chicken on the stick was so over cook and dried out. You can't enjoy them. Shrimp Lo mein is still do-able but its not as juicy and tasteful as it used to be. After 3 disappointment visits, I have waited awhile and said I can settle for some shrimp fried rice. You really can't go wrong there. Well I was incorrect. This has been the worst and normally my daughter orders this with everytime and it's always good. This rice was hard, a major turn off. It was so light as if they tried to fry white rice and serve it. It was so not good. Sad to lose a loyal customer who orders from here at least 2x a week.",

The bread was stale and crunchy, despite seeming fresh and pulled from the oven, and the onions were slimy and on the verge of not being safe to eat.  \n\nThere's another subway 2 blocks away on Chestnut.

The yogurt was tart and the fruit was ripe - nothing wrong here!\n\nRed Mango will get the job done if you're craving some froyo.

This is the first self-serve Red Mango that I've been to, and given that it was one of our first warm weekends it was not as crowded as I anticipated - but it does not bode well for when the heat reaches its peak in summer. The layout is fine, with the 10 different rotating flavors on the back wall, leading to the toppings bar that has a large and nice assortment of fruits, nuts, cereals, etc. There are tables and chairs too for patrons, and a restroom in back behind the froyo. The froyo flavors are tasty, but most importantly for froyo the TEXTURE is smooth and creamy, and relatively satisfying for froyo. WAAAAAAYYYYYY better than Sweet Endings.\n\nBUT the moment there is a crowd of people trying to get froyo, the entire interior will instantly be clogged as patrons try to taste different flavors, can't make up their mind, wait in what will definitely be a slow line to get toppings, and THEN pay at the cramped register area...it'll be a shit show with half melted froyo by the time you pay and can *technically* eat your creation. We'll see what things look like in a month or two, once it's late spring and schools are out...",

Over the past few months, the food and the service has been less than satisfying.\n\nThe pizza lately has little-to-no flavor and is COVERED in way too much tasteless sauce, so much that the cheese can't even stay on and is usually all over the box when it's delivered! The fries are always soggy and never taste like they were cooked long enough, but most recently we ordered cheesesteaks and the rolls were stale and hard as bricks!!\n\nIt's disappointing with a family of 5 and spending $50 each time. And then the customer service has also gone down hill! When I call for an order they always make it seem like you are bothering them by calling, and speak incredibly unprofessionally using phrases like \"uh huh\" \"yup\" and \"what else.\" \n\nOne time my mom ordered and forgot to give the credit card number over the phone. I called back and the lady actually SIGHED at me. For calling to PAY!! Then there is a creepy older driver who always asks me about my toddler son which makes me uncomfortable. Sadly, this place is no longer a 'family favorite'",

Great buffalo sauce that's slightly sweet, but balanced out by a little heat.\n\nNegatives - Again, I don't come here often, but I've never had anything bad.

The lines are managed efficiently, and I've never had to wait too long for my order. They definitely run a pretty tight ship here. \n\nThe one and only complaint I have is that kids from the charter school across the street have taken to hanging out in there sometimes. The managers do their best to kick the kids out, but I've been in there more than once when their rowdiness was an issue.",

Partially that was accomplished because even though it was during what I would have assumed would have been a busy lunch rush, the place was deserted.  Over the course of twenty minutes every table got wiped, the soda fountain nozzles all were taken off & cleaned and all trash was taken out. #impressive\n\nThe food itself was typical Subway dreck where even when it's right it's still only right to a point as the bread was too soft almost like it was underdone and the apples in the cooler were mostly brown but whatever.\n\nFor better or worse it's cheap, it's filling and the location is perfect for when we're in town.",

        "text": "By all means, if you value your health, do not eat from here. I recently ate at Panera in Jenkintown and had the worst experience ever. First, I placed a mobile app order and decided to pick it up around 12 for lunch. When I got there, my order wasn't in the \"Online Orders\" section of the store. I asked the cashier girl if she could locate my food and it was sitting on the counter behind her. She looked at the receipt for a few minutes, looked around like she needed help with something, then finally handed it to me. I'm not sure why it was back there or why she was acting so strange around my food since it was paid for and sitting there for pick-up. Next, I get home and open up my package with my chicken quinoa broth bowl with French bread and the bread isn't in a cover or wrapped up, it's just lying on top of the plastic bowls. I eat the sub par food, which tasted strange, and went on with my day. I didn't eat dinner that night since I wasn't feeling too well. I woke up the next morning with serious stomach cramps and nausea. I realized about 2 days after I had eaten the food that the Panera is what got me sick. I wasn't able to eat solid foods from Thursday - Tuesday. I called corporate (who were very helpful) and explained to them what happened. Since this Panera is not corporate owned, they contacted the store manager and she gave me a call. Jennifer, the store manager, was extremely rude and insensitive. She stated that none of the food is made at the store. Instead everything comes prepackaged and they just microwave it and serve it. That's just gross to start off with. I thought this food was fresh, not frozen, packaged and shipped in order to be reheated and served. I might as well eat leftovers. The quality of this food is not worth the money spent on it. Next, she said that there is no way I could have contracted anything from her store because nothing is cooked on premises. But isn't the food handled when reheated? Or the server doesn't wash his/her hands? Or when it gets put into the container? Or how about when the bread is just laying on top of plastic that hasn't been washed or cleaned? Then she stated that I must have \"gotten the flu from somewhere else.\" I didn't know that Jennifer is also a Doctor/Panera Bread Manager. She assumed I didn't get sick from there, she didn't say sorry, she didn't help in anyway possible. I didn't want any compensation or gift card or  anything; I just wanted to let someone know that something in their food made me sick. After this unbelievable conversation with her, where she badgered me and made me feel worse about my situation, I called corporate back and they contacted the district manager. He spoke to me and said he would talk to her and the staff about customer service. Honestly, she needs to learn about customer service, being friendly, and understanding the situation before letting ignorance and stupidity get in the way of clear judgement. Hopefully Jennifer gets the proper help she most desperately needs. If I were you, I wouldn't risk eat at this Panera or any Panera for that matter. It's just not worth it.",

I counted 4 employees working only one cashier though she was picking the bagels and cutting them. the other workers were in back area I saw the manager and made eye contact with her a couple times hoping she would wait on but she was busy talking to another girl. I waited about 5 minutes to finally place my order. After you order you have to go to back to get order which I will say this was rather quick. I asked for a toasted bagel with cream cheese bagel was barely toasted cream cheese was in a small container which was a brand I never heard of was horrible. I usually go to Manhattan bagel a couple stores up but was very crowded. Thought I could save time and go to panera but probably spent same amount of time for a far inferior product.",

Reviews for this Popeyes location were good so took a detour on the way home to pick up the food order.\n\nPrior reviews mentioned that this was a clean location and this is very apparent when one steps into this joint. The interiors are super clean and well maintained (including the rest rooms). \n\nThe chicken tenders were freshly prepared and the last time we had memorably good ones from a fast food spot was at a service area at 5AM (was the first batch). The side of blackened ranch was zesty and paired well with the crispy and spicy tenders. Hit the sweet spot for us and left us feeling so satisfied. Would definitely come back here in the future.

I ordered the salmon combo (yes, points off from me for creativity, but the basics provide a good grounds for a sampling. and I was having a craving, so there) and it was very mediocre. The salmon roll was cut haphazardly and the rice was a little too gummy. The sashimi wasn't perfectly cut and was almost chewy and the sushi was diminished by the not quite right rice. The quality of the fish was excellent though, and that was good. I would not object to going back to Hikari if friends wanted to go (and I would of course like to try more of their menu and give them a shot at earning the third star), but given my druthers, I will choose Zento in Old City any day.",
