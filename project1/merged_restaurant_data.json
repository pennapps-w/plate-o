I (and a few of the people I was with) made a few annoying modifications to my breakfast sandwich and my server handled it wonderfully. The food came out fast and our server was very attentive.\nMy bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich on a bagel was very good and homefries were exceptional. Some places like this have homefries that were previously frozen and lame, these were fresh and nicely seasoned. A person I was with got a toasted sandwich on sourdough and it was perfectly cooked, big and golden brown. \nIt's a pleasant little space with lots of nice outdoor seating, and the food is all very reasonably priced. Ignore the old negative reviews, whatever the problem was, something has changed and this place is awesome.",

The place had nobody else in it, but it took a while for the waitress to come and ask for our order. I got the strawberry cheesecake french toast. I was expecting a regular french toast with cheesecake filling and fresh strawberries. What I got was really greasy, with a little bit of cheesecake filling.. and drowning in canned strawberry \"pie filling\". I call it pie filling because I am not entirely sure what it is supposed to be. It was an artificial tasting bright red smooth jelly-like textured substance.. almost jello. I took a few bites but felt so unhealthy I could not finish it. The waitress asked if the food was delicious and I said yes because I didn't want to sound rude.",

The food was fairly decent which is why this is a 2 star as opposed to a 1 star review.  My issue is that the business REFUSES to post pricing on their menus.  I just looked @ Panera's website and there is STILL no prices whatever on their menus.  People are on fixed budgets and have fixed means of income for crying out loud?!  I would therefore be @ the mercy of the honesty of the then co-worker as to how much I would be charged - thankfully said person is honest.  If I remember correctly when she called in the orders she was not apprised of the prices until she went over to pick up the stuff - she's much more comfortable about driving on Street Road than I am or I'd go over to check it out myself.  I am surprised no one mentioned this as you would think there would be local or state legislation requiring pricing be placed on menus - printed or online.  This BTW is the ONLY food business I ever encountered this with.  Even today (1/23/17) there is NO pricing on their online menu; they tout having a transparent menu - without pricing as far as I'm concerned it is NOT transparent enough!  I neither live nor work near one of their locations currently and with NO pricing posted I definitely will not go out of my way to patronize these locations.",

Got my cookie order wrong (ordered choc. chip, got oatmeal raisin). \nThe tortellini was dry and hard in places, indicative of sitting in a steamer tray for too long. Portions were really quite stingy for twenty bucks' worth of food. Everything was pretty bland considering how much salt is in it. \nIt's a chain restaurant, so my expectations were set accordingly. Even then, I give it a \"D\".",

There is only a front door & a back door. To get to the back door, you must either walk through the grass to the right, or walk in the middle of the road, because there is no sidewalk on the side of Subway, along with the non existent side door. I could see a few customers inside, & the lady employee, & I tried waving at them to get someone to open the front door, as I cannot open doors without assistance, & everyone inside either laughed & shook  their heads, or pretended not to hear me. Some junkie finally opened the door & the laughing customers kept laughing & making comments. I asked if my being handicapped amuses them & they said it's hilarious because I was causing a scene. I wasn't originally causing a scene. I explained that there's no side door & I'm not struggling to get stuck in the grass or in middle of the road & get hit by a car. Employee was also laughing her @$$ off & I said to let me out. Door was locked & she laughed & said she was too busy to let me out. \nHer excuse for the front door being locked was because she's working alone & doesn't want to get robbed. Nobody can park out front, only in back, so, if she was going to get robbed, getaway car would be out back. There's nowhere for a robber to run away out front, except right into the 5 way intersection directly out front. Horrible things were said to me by the customers (ask me)\nI'm never going back there.

On the right when you walk in are paper menus and pencils, with which you record your order. There are a few favorites listed at the top, and then you have the option to create your own combos by choosing a coating, topping, and a drizzle. The donuts are made fresh to order and the line moves along relatively quickly, especially when you're distracted by all the choices on the menu.\n\nOnce we placed our order, the donuts were made pretty quickly. However, it did take quite a bit for them to make the coffee. Once the donuts are done, they showed us the box and asked if they looked good, upon which my sister and I requested that they add more powder onto our powder donuts (which they did).\n\nI ordered one powder and one with chocolate coating/chocolate topping/fudge drizzle. The donuts were absolutely delicious! My sister enjoyed her powdered, and her graham cracker sprinkled creation was tasty as well. My boyfriend enjoyed his pb & jelly donut, and he was surprised that he also liked the bacon donut.\n\nThere's a fridge with some beverages such as apple juice and etc, but I prefer my donuts with a cold milk. Milks were only sold via tiny carton, so I had to buy 2. My only suggestion is that they supply the fridge with larger cartons. I'm sure we'll be back again soon.",

This place is by far the best around all the way down to the northeast! The chicken parm sandwich is my top fav, mozzarella sticks are good with good dipping sauce, plain pizza delish, Sicilian is amazing, and try the spinach tomato pie, you won't be disappointed!

However, the service there is very helpful and friendly, so they get to keep a star for that.\n\nTheir regular slices  are very mediocre, teetering towards the side of bad. Crispy and burnt, the sauce is nothing special and the toppings just fall right off. I can eat them, but I'd rather not. Stick to Sicilian if you're getting a pie here. The garlic knots are large, I'll give them that, but very dry unless you put the (extremely spicy) oil at the counter on them to moisten them up. Plus, there's not enough garlic in them.\n\nA very mediocre experience at this place, which is a shame.",

        "text": "TWO SLICE SPECIAL REVIEW ONLY\n\nThe price at $4.99 for two large slices of pizza and a soft drink was excellent.  The size of the slices was also more than expected. The service was friendly.  The room was small, with only two tables for those who want to eat their pizza just out of the oven when it is at its prime. So, this is basically a take out joint. \n\nWe wanted a quick bite to tide us over until dinner. A slice apiece and sharing the drink was our intention. \n\nI requested that the reheat be \"well done,\" in order to bring the ingredients back to life after sitting on display. \n\nWhat we received were slices that were not hot in the center where the cheese was thickest. That was likely due to the excessive amount of cheese piled onto the pie, out of proportion to the tomato sauce which seemed sparingly used. The result was pizza that could not be picked up by the crust because it was too heavy on the topside.  The taste was weak because of the cheese/sauce imbalance, and perhaps the quality of the cheese and sauce themselves.  The crust would have been improved with a little salt added to the dough.  \n\nNot an impressive effort by Pizza Land.",

I did it back in college in Atlanta, GA. I worked at a mall called Perimeter Mall, but I digress... With the typical mallrat children/teenagers, low life's, and generally weird people frequenting any mall in America - there comes some stress to the mall employees. However, this is the job you chose. Out of tons of other jobs...I might add. So, I feel it's important to do your job well and amicably. Oh yeah, I feel like the \"amicable\" part is part of the job - not a result that you get when your lucky, or attractive, or intelligent, etc. \nI did not like the annoyed and cold demeanor of the staff. I felt that them limiting me to one sample was odd. However, I did not complain. When the 2nd woman came to the counter she started pointing to different entrees remarking \"good!\" (I guess she was helping me choose...without knowing me.), I did not complain. Even we they starting speaking in another language while serving me - clearly annoyed at the time taken by me to chose entrees off sight alone, I did not complain. All of those observations together = last visit for me. Go around the corner to Chick-fil-A, their service could make a vegetarian happy!",

The woman said yes. I get to a table & open my container& there are no vegetables. My fountain soda was flat. My husband ordered peppered beef, and he said he honestly can't tell if it's fish or not.\n\nI decided I wanted to go back to tell them how awful it was (which I did as nicely as possible), and the woman told me it wasn't peppered steak it was pork. So I'm like \"Well, why does the sign say peppered steak then?\" Oh, well THAT'S steak. I pay $40 for one pound for that beef. It's good beef.  \n\nOk, whatever, looney tune. Nobody pays $40 for a pound of crappy Chinese takeout beef. Now I'm seriously worried that we're going to get food poisoning.",

I'm a huge sushi fan (literally, and figuratively), and as a result I often find myself torn when looking for lunch in the Plymouth Meeting/Blue Bell area. Do I spend a lot of money (and time) going out for lunch at Bluefin or Woojung? Both are great places that deserve the praise, but I wouldn't really consider either for a quick and casual lunch during the week. As an alternative I would grab something from the to-go counter at Whole Foods, but I never felt like I was getting enough for the money in that case. Never enough freshness or flavor. Enter: Sushi Lover.\n\nLocated within the mall itself, it goes against the trend of putting new attractions outside the mall proper. It is on the lower level, between the carousel and children's play area. Local old-timers like myself might remember a snack bar located in this general spot 20+ years ago, but I digress. Anyway, from the outside it doesn't look like much...assuming you ever see it to begin with (not a lot of food traffic inside the mall these days, alas). But it solves my casual sushi dilemma perfectly. Quick, fresh, and affordable. \n\nSpecialty rolls (like a Volcano roll) are 50% cheaper than what the other area champs would charge, and you get the benefit of something freshly prepared to order instead of sitting in a box like you would find at Whole Foods (this place is an even better deal than Whole Foods, come to think of it). They also have made-to-order smoothies and bubble teas, in a variety of flavors. Very friendly people too. The #5 combo has 6 pieces of sashimi, 4 pieces of nigiri, and an 8-piece California roll for $11.99. All prepared fresh to order (and the sashimi portions are extremely generous). No, they don't have the breadth of menu as found at the afore-mentioned spots, but that isn't what I what on a Wednesday during the one hour I can get away from the office. This place has what I want, as it has found the perfect equilibrium between my usual options for sushi goodness. Worth a visit!",

Still was ok..tried the green apple but not what I expected. \n\nThey have numerous rolls,standard and special, and plenty of beverages to choose from including bubble tea \n\nThe Philadelphia roll was fresh and so yummy,  looking forward to trying the miso soup",

It has a small TV, but the staff always knows what to play. They recently added new sliding glass over the condiments so you can easily interact with staff.",

I myself have worked in the food industry and I know it is all about the customer, I felt the complete opposite. When I walked into the store there was no one at the counter and when she came she said nothing to me but looked at me, I just thought well maybe she is having a bad day and continued to tell her my order. I told her \"light oil\" and instead she put started to put mayo I told her \"No i'm sorry I said oil.\" I absolutely hate mayo and she tried to argue with me and said \"You said light mayo\" she then took her glove inside out and started to wipe the mayo off of my sandwich it had to be the most unsanitary thing I have ever seen. I grabbed a bag of chips and put them on the counter she rang me up without asking did I want the which I did want the one with the sandwich, chips and drink she then rolled her eyes and just told me the total. I had to grab my own fountain cup and than there were no straws! I asked her for a straw and her response was her shaking her head! I was furious but I only had a 30 min lunch break, I have never been treated so rudely by someone before.",

Clean would also be good.\n\nNotice I didn't say low calorie!  That's the last thing you should expect here.\n\nGenerally they almost always come through on the other four.  If you like spicy, this is your place.  From the chicken to the Cajun fries, there are plenty of items that will make your tongue tingle.  The Blackened Ranch Dipping Sauce is to die for.  For about $6 you can get plenty of food and an unlimited fountain soda. The parking lot is giant so there is no problem getting in and out quickly.  \n\nLike most places that make food in advance, it's a mistake to go here within an hour or so of closing.  When I was dumb enough to do that I was rewarded with food that had been sitting too long.  Other than that they do a solid job.",

Service was quick, in and out.\n\nIt is snugged away in a corner of philly in the viet area. Plenty of parking in the lot. Plenty of restaurants in the area too.\n\nThis is a chain and surprisingly similar standards and quality across the board. \n\nJust to reiterate, the 3 bean dessert was delicious and all the components fresh and well proportioned. Unfortunately the taro smoothie was powder and not fresh, it was sweet beyond belief and did not even taste like taro. Will not be ordering that in the future but I will be back. \n\nHappy eating.",

I ordered my drinks and they did the mistake twice, they also did it to another customer which I saw before me. Once I taste mine, it was not to my standard, my partner asked for them to make another one, a different drink and she is willing to pay the difference maybe a dollar or two, but no, the manager told her she has to pay full!!\nI didn't know that she had to do this when she came back with the drink but then I saw the receipt. \n\nAt this point I didn't event want to drink the new \"dessert\", I want to throw it at their faces but my partner was telling me don't do it. So, we left the place, going to the car, when I took the drink from her hand and went back with her kind of screaming behind my back scared about what I was going to do.(so I don't get arrested for destruction of property) I slammed the drink in the counter in front of the cashier and told her, \"give this to your fucking manager, this is not how you do your fucking business!!\" then I left.\n\nSide note: the woman that got her drink messed up by the cashier also talk with us in the parking lot and asked us if the same thing happened and said she's so disappointed and won't come back. People who own business usually will take the loss in order to please their customers, not do things like this!",

I picked the number 2: Ch\u00e8 thp cm (combination) - Red bean, white bean, green/mung bean, taro, pandan jelly, pearl, combo jelly.  I thought i would like this but there was just too much red and white bean and they were huge ( i should've known better).  I did like that it was not too sweet.  These type of desserts are similar to halo-halo (filipino shaved ice with toppings) but not at all as sugary.  I also tried the guy's number 4: Ch\u00e8 sng s\u00e1o ht lu - Grass jelly, red tapioca, pandan jelly, jello, mung bean.  Much better than mine since no red/white beans.  It would be better if they used a lid that had a bigger hole, like what dunkin donuts used for their iced drinks.  There just isn't enough room for the spoon and straw!  We came on a sunday afternoon and the place was busy but we didn't have a long wait after ordering.",

The owner refused to honor the second coupon and gave me an attitude.  Honestly, the customer service in this location sucks.  Owner also did not give me the corporate napkins too, which could possibly be a violation of their franchise agreement.  Corporate, please take note.",

Instead of going to my usual Vietnamese place, I tried Pho Saigon since I was at the distributor next door.  I ordered the chicken vermicelli with a spring roll.  The only good thing I can is that the vermicelli is very good.  The spring roll was burnt and greasy.  I took one bite and threw it out.  The chicken came with the skin on, which I don't prefer.  I would have been willing to overlook it, but like the spring roll, it was also very greasy.  I might give this place another shot to try out the pho, but otherwise I won't be back.",

I ordered my lunch as usual, now it was delivered but it was missing the main part the SOUP. Which isn't a big deal i thought, well apparently after speaking with \"Summer\" was told that they do not deliver nor do they give refunds. I asked to speak to a manager AARON hoping i could actually get my lunch. Aaron was very rude and condescending. He did not apologize and tried to shift the blame on the delivery service door dash. I spend a lot of money eating there and this is the last time i will EVER support this location. After about 20 minutes of holding passing me back and forth btw summer and this manger Aaron They issued me a refund of 2 dollars for the missing soup. Disgraceful! They should have refunded the whole bill amount or try to fix the situation. Which they refused to deliver my soup, so i had to leave work and go get food some where else. So much for loyal customers, loyalty is not something Panera specializes in.  Very very disappointed",

All my orders were correct and my latte tasted as good as I would expect it. I can't say that about any other Panera that have been too.",

Once i got the sandwich I opened it right away just to check it before leaving , I had bread grilled chicken and lots of Parmesan cheese no lettuce , no Caesar no onions . I told the manager he said he would make me another right away  which he made me ( and I didn't check ) got home and it was also completely wrong but It was  better but wrong .

Parking in the back isn't great but you'll eventually find something. \n\nSome of my favorites are the Napa Almond Chicken Salad Sandwich, French Onion soup and the coffee cake ring. Who am I trying to kid? I love all pastries. Newly discovered favorite side dish, the mac & cheese. Tastes like Stouffers from back in the day; it's creamy & delicious.\n\nTheir baguettes are fantastic, but I usually get the apple as my side and going to say, you need to do better on finding these apples. I love the size, but sometimes they are mealy. Get a good, crisp, mini apple and you've got a customer for life.\n\nWhen it's busy, I get it, but I personally haven't had a moment where I'm fuming mad. Get some lemonade and patiently wait for your tasty meal to be ready.",

Banh uot was solid, though to be fair, there's not much cooking involved. The pho was missing some depth to its flavor and the broth could have been a bit clearer. I was also disappointed that there wasn't any tripe in the pho either. The bun mam was flavorful but a bit greasy with a thick layer of oil on top.\n\nPortions are good though and service is nice.

Domino's really can't compete with quality local pizza, but unfortunately in this area, that's slim pickings around here!  In terms of taste and quality, I think Domino's food is better than their chain-pizza competitors.\n\nPer this particular location, the food is often prepared in a timely manner, the people are usually nice when I go in to pick it up and everything has turned out as expected.\n\nAs for the pizza, I've never been a big fan of Domino's red sauce since they changed it a few years back, but you can't help but love the garlic crust that also came about when they were making pizza taste changes.  My personal favorite Domino's pizzas to order are a white pizza with bacon and their BBQ chicken pizza.\n\nI haven't had too many other non-pizza offerings, but the chicken parm sandwich is pretty tasty and I've always been a fan of their cheesy bread.  The only other thing I've had is their boneless chicken and that definitely wasn't worth the money for the amount you get.\n\nOverall -- it's Domino's and for a Domino's this is a good Domino's. If you like chain pizza, this location is a good one to get your food from.",

The broth is really flavorful, they give you plenty of meat, it's cheap and the portions are HUGE.\n\nThe only downfalls- The place smelled like a dirty rag and although I don't ever expect frequent water refills or even water at all at a pho place, I at least expect it if I ask for it.  I asked the one waiter and he walked 2 feet to the counter and forgot.  He ended up chatting with someone then walking back to clear tables.  I had to go to the counter and get it myself.",

We were  here today at 7:10 am, and as is the norm, they had no more souffles.  I asked how they are out of souffles this early in the day. The surly person at the counter was clearly annoyed and rudely said \"they're in the oven and it will take 20 minutes!\" It would have been helpful to know that when I first inquired.\nThis is this place's mo-jo. I am tempted to sit down with the manager and ask if they keep inventory of how many souffles they sell per 1/2 hour in the morning. It should be predictable - they should never be out of souffles. The staff clearly needs more customer service training.\nSo don't waste your time here. Pick a friendly neighborhood diner instead.",

        "text": "Unfortunately I've become an ex-Panera Bread customer due to an incident that happened in January of this year. In preparation for the predicted blizzard, my wife was out running some errands and called me asking if I wanted her to pick up something for lunch while she was still out. I suggested that I place an order with Panera using the phone app that I had used many times before and she could just walk in and pick it up without a hassle since payment happens at the time of order. As an after thought, I put two cookies on the order prior to final submission and scheduled it for 11:30 pick up. After fighting considerable problems finding a place to park in the shopping center due to traffic caused by the upcoming snow, she ran in and took the bag with our order from the pick up shelf and headed home. Upon arriving home, we opened the bag and discovered that the two cookies had not been placed in the bag even though I had been billed for them. I immediately called the restaurant and spoke to a girl who obviously could care less and was just in a hurry to get me off the phone. She said if I came back down, I could pick up the cookies. I stated that due to the traffic situation, I would just like a credit written on my Amex card for the two cookies at $1.99 each. She said the manager would have to do that procedure and he wasn't available. I gave her my order number, phone number, etc. and told her to have someone call if there was a problem. I waited until the following week and the credit had not shown up on my card. Frustrated, I went to the Panera website and detailed my problem as stated above. I left all my contact information, etc. NO ONE BOTHERED REPLYING TO MY EMAIL COMPLAINT! So, for the lack of response over two cookies, Panera has lost a loyal customer. I will not return to any Panera location based on their terrible lack of customer service. Although I will certainly miss the cinnamon crunch bagels, I can't return to a business that treats customers in this manner.",

I said ok, I'll try it but I specifically asked if they put peanuts on it, he said no, but just in case I asked him to please make sure there's no peanuts. Many Vietnamese dishes love to top their dishes with peanuts. Hubby got his dish and he said it was average. Few minutes after he got his, I got my mango salad, with peanuts . They took it back and made another one. The mango had a nice crunch to it. After about my 3rd piece I realize, there was no chicken. I asked my hubby if I heard it wrong and he agreed that the waiter did mention there was chicken in it. I didn't want to send it back again. I just ate the mango dish and left it at that. Between the mango salad (which is quite a small dish) and his pork chop rice with viet coffee, it cost close to $30. Maybe the waiter didn't familiarize all the dishes yet. But I can give it another try for their hot pot next time :) as for their dishes, in my opinion, it tasted like any viet dish I've had around.",

We all thoroughly enjoyed our sandwiches. Not what you would refer to as a typically Philly cheesesteak but still tasty. The gluten free sandwich took some extra time to come out but they explained that it was because they had to take the time to clean the grill. That made us feel much better that they understand what it means to be gluten free! We will definitely return.",

Unfortunately, we were really disappointed.\n\nWe got regular size hoagies that look nothing like the photo they show on their website. They said one sandwich would \"feed 2 people\" for almost $10 with tax. What 2 people do you know who will eat 3.5\" of sandwich for a meal and be satisfied? Not two grown-adult non-anorexic Philadelphians. Was this a mistake by a new employee or something?\n\nThis place is new, and I try to pad reviews for newer places even when I don't dig them, but in this case, I could not finish eating my meal, so I can't ignore that.\n\nJust under $19 for two 7\" hoagies that were Wawa quality, from roll, to meats, to mayo.\n\nIn fairness, I am not a chain hoagie person. If you like places like Primo's, Subway or Wawa, then by all means, help yourself to Jersey Mike's. But if you are more of a mom-n-pop authentic Philly sandwich type of person, who has come to know the quality meats, toppings and rolls that our area has to offer, then I don't think the quality at this place will stand up to what you're used to.\n\nWe had a turkey hoagie and an Italian, both were very low-quality meats. Also, the veggies were tasteless and the roll was terrible. It was definitely the kind of roll you'd get at Subway, not at all something that tasted fresh from a Philly bakery.\n\nMy turkey was the same rubbery-looking stuff they give you at Wawa. I could not finish. Wasted half the sandwich, which was only 7 measly inches to begin with.\n\nThe Italian was no better. Not much flavor, all lower-quality ingredients. Thinly-packed, with not much in it at all. Again, very disappointing.\n\nThey put a lot of hype into their marketing and advertising, and have fancy logo-printed wax paper and bags. The bag and wax paper presentation was like Burger King. Please, save the money on the logos and put it into better quality ingredients. To us, you just branded something we will never eat again, and couldn't finish. Wasted money. Had to go out again to get takeout elsewhere just to finish dinner.\n\nSorry Jersey Mike's, we heard great things about you on Philly.com and thought you'd be different from Primo's. I guess a franchise, is a franchise, is a franchise. It's just not for us.",

Oh any Veterans they have military discount there. When we sat in our car to eat my wife showed me her cheesesteak sandwich, it looked like the gold doors opened and a bright light came out and the angels were singing, I mean this sandwich looked BEAUTIFUL! and my wife eat it and it tasted even better, a work of art. So my wife went back in to compliment the cook by the way her name is Sara, and she told my wife that she was a chef but lost her job because of covid 19. SUPERB! So if any restaurants is looking for a great chef her name is Sara. And now my score.........\n1000 points!!!",

The only thing was for a custom order they didn't pay attention to the notes I included about no spicy peppers or white rice instead of fried rice. Food tasted yummy.",

The driver came to the door in a Santa suit I hobbled to the door after recent foot surgery signed for my order said Merry Christmas to the driver and got a silent stare in return.

Seem to be a slower overall then other subways I've gone to in the area.\n\nPersonally I go for the chicken teriyaki sandwich with extra meat, lettuce and onions. Service has been hit and miss. Sometimes the lettuce and onions don't look particular fresh though and I wish the manager would work to make this place better.\n\nOverall you get a good sandwich with or without the extra meat for a decent price just expect to get it slower then other locations.",

The service was fast, and the employees were helpful and of course what my sister and I got both was really tasty and refreshing. We told them it was our first time, and they said they use all fresh fruit and everything they have is refreshing. \n\nI got a mango smoothie, which only comes in a medium size and it had small chunks of frozen mango. The medium was a good size but it was $4.75, which is a bit expensive. \n\nMy sister got the mango tea with fresh pulp in the large size. She asked for boba pearls which was 75\u00a2 extra for the topping, so hers ended up being $6.25 but the large is a good size. My sister says it was very fresh. \n\nInside the actual store front it was a good size, not too big and not too small. It had some tables and chairs to wait or sit and eat in. I was able to pay with my card, and tip on their iPad and text the receipt to my phone easy peasy. Overall I would go back again,   especially because the location was close to my house. There are also a lot of other locations near my house, which speaks to their popularity in the area. 10/10",

Tsos Bean Curds because she said it was good, n boy was she right! The tofu was nice n crisp outside, and not mushy. The sauce was sweet n spicy, just right. The food was piping hot. My nephew ate honey chicken with pork fried rice, but i couldn't see the pork, LOL. He said the chicken was really good, n his eggroll likewise. I also had hot n sour soup, which was delicious as not many places can make it good. I ordered a scallion pancake which my SIS liked, but i thought was just a Lil too doughy for me, but dipping sauce was good. SIS n i both had springrolls, n she devoured hers, n i will eat mine with my leftovers. N this establishment happens to have brown rice, which I prefer over white rice. Overall, I was pleased n impressed, as initial impression was...I sure hope their food is good. I will definitely be back, n i added them to yelp so others can enjoy their food too!!!!",

The yogurt was tart and the fruit was ripe - nothing wrong here!\n\nRed Mango will get the job done if you're craving some froyo.

I'm glad there's now a cinnamon roll-like treat that we can both enjoy! \n\nAnd of course, everything else we got was incredible too.

I hate to say it, because I have only the best feeling about this bakery, but it wasn't up to par this time. Here's the reason why: there was NO salt in the baguette (I mean none at all.) I'm assuming this was a mistake that the baker made - someone just forgot to add the salt in one batch. It happens. The bread was still okay, but a baguette without salt just tastes really lacking. I can get past it for Tuscan bread or a soft pretzel, but for this loaf, I just couldn't get past it. \nI will definitely be trying again next week and hopefully I will get another stellar loaf like the previous one I had. I also can't wait to try their croissants and brioche loaf! So I will try them again soon and re-update this, hopefully with better news!",

Granted I don't come here very often, but I've never experienced anything subpar or awful.\n\nThe Buffalo tails are off the hook. Great buffalo sauce that's slightly sweet, but balanced out by a little heat.\n\nNegatives - Again, I don't come here often, but I've never had anything bad. The pizza fries weren't very good and lacked sauce and cheese, but it wasn't a deal breaker.\n\nThe customer service was fine to me, but I could see how they could possibly rub some people the wrong way.",

So of course, I came to this place with big hopes but little expectations.  \n\nNow, let me just say hat this was one of the best food stands/trucks type around Temple that I have ever encountered. \n\nI was totally surprised by the amount of chicken, roasted pork, and shrimp in the serving!  Trust me, it's not just a deceiving few laid on top, and you'll never have to dig through it to find some meat.  With that said, I thought the chicken was a little dry...but the pork and shrimp made up for it and the portions were definitely generous for only $5.50!!!!  I haven't tried its other dishes but I can testify that the Singapore Mei Fun is well worth the price. \n\nAlso the food comes in a decent sized aluminum plate with a plastic cover, which I think is much more convenient and healthy than the cheap styrofoam lunch boxes.  And instead of a plastic bag, you'll get a paper lunch bag, yay! \n\nAnyway, the service is fast and efficient; I went a little past 1 and there was not much of a line when I got there.  If you're unsure about what to order, try the mei fun!\n\nOh, and the guy indeed yells SING MEI in a very cool manner.  :)",

They have two girls that work there that are friendly and polite.  Every other girl they have working there is just down right rude.  One girl even tries to put less meat on your sandwich if she thinks you are not looking.  They act like it is an inconvenience if you have to ask them what kind of soup they have but you always have to ask because they never update the board that tells you.  I, unfortunatly, am stuck going to this location if I want subway for lunch because I only have a short lunch break and this is the only location that I am able to make it to in my time frame.  If you are able to avoid this subway I would definatly reccomend finding a different location.",

One the best parts about this place is that they always have plenty veggie patties on hand, which for a vegetarian, is a nice option.\n\nI got a footlong Veggie Delite yesterday and it was a good, cheap dinner.  The components were decent for what they were, albeit none of high quality or in their prime.  The hoagie was well made with the right amounts of oil and vinegar and seasoning.\n\nIt's pretty well kept in the dining area, and the staff has always been professional and quick.  I've never had a language barrier at this location, and I go in once a month or so.\n\nNothing earth shattering here folks, it's still a Subway, but it's a decent one.",

At first I felt let down that I'm in south philly with all these great sandwich places and I'm stuck eating subway. But boy was I wrong. The food was do good and I loved the lunch box they served it in. Also the cookie was so tasty. I have to admit that subway has upped their game and food was even better than panera and Corner bakery were we usually cater from in our blue bell office.",

The wontons were thick with a good filling and held together well. \nButterfly shrimp with bacon is an old school Shanghai delicacy that I can rarely find anymore. It was juicy and flavorful. \nThe Singapore mai fun was some of the best I've had, with lots of chicken and seafood added. Same with the happy family, lots of beef, pork shrimp chicken and seafood to be had in this dish. \nThe standout piece was the shredded pork with garlic sauce. Just the right amount of spice was added,  with some nice heat. The pork was tender and tasty. \nPlace inside was clean, staff was very friendly.",

I have to say, they always forget my croutons for my Tomato soup, but then again, so do all of the others. The thing that I LOVE the best about this Panera is the fact that there's a manager expediting the food at the counter on the customer waiting side. This may not seem like a big deal, but I hate when the customers are all grouped up trying to figure out, \"is this my sandwich, or is this yours?\" The employees sometimes say your name so quickly, you're luckily if you get a hint of it at all. I really give them props for this and will continue to choose this location over the others!",

I counted 4 employees working only one cashier though she was picking the bagels and cutting them. the other workers were in back area I saw the manager and made eye contact with her a couple times hoping she would wait on but she was busy talking to another girl. I waited about 5 minutes to finally place my order. After you order you have to go to back to get order which I will say this was rather quick. I asked for a toasted bagel with cream cheese bagel was barely toasted cream cheese was in a small container which was a brand I never heard of was horrible. I usually go to Manhattan bagel a couple stores up but was very crowded. Thought I could save time and go to panera but probably spent same amount of time for a far inferior product.",

The space is clean and attractive, with a well hidden drive thru component around to the back.  \n\nI went in the other evening for a light dinner and to help nourish my life long Southern Fried Chicken addiction. I just can't seem to get enough.  Love the crunch and the hot oil burning my fingers. Love the spicy coat.  Love the way it pulls away from the bone with a little coaxing. \n\nThese days, fried chicken is offered on the more sophisticated menus, and even for breakfast with waffles for those who just want max carb load.  (I'm not there yet.)  But, just because someone with a chef's hat and culinary school degree puts a batch together doesn't mean it is any better than the cheaper, faster, mass produced variety.  In fact, there is a school of thought that fried chicken is like singing the blues.  You know; \"You have to suffer if you want to sing the blues...\" Those hands playing six string acoustic or even Lucille, bring something to the experience that can be felt deep in the soul.  \n\nChicken be that way, too.  The true fried chicken artists, like the best Delta or Hills Blues guitarists and singers, are rooted in a culture and existential angst that generates the creative instinct leading to emotionally charged performances.  Those same forces are at work with fried chicken.  In the hands of a master, the chicken becomes an extension of his life, the same way a great song emerges from that primordial place deep in the heart.\n\nThis 2 piece box o' chicken may not have been epic, but it was solid and even inspired this review.  So, even though we weren't sitting in Muscle Shoals, Alabama in a roadside chicken house, there was enough there to let the imagination run wild.\n\nJust wish they actually played that music at Popeye's, rather than the current soundtrack.",

Reviews for this Popeyes location were good so took a detour on the way home to pick up the food order.\n\nPrior reviews mentioned that this was a clean location and this is very apparent when one steps into this joint. The interiors are super clean and well maintained (including the rest rooms). \n\nThe chicken tenders were freshly prepared and the last time we had memorably good ones from a fast food spot was at a service area at 5AM (was the first batch). The side of blackened ranch was zesty and paired well with the crispy and spicy tenders. Hit the sweet spot for us and left us feeling so satisfied. Would definitely come back here in the future. Very friendly customer service.",

They were quick to seat my party and gave us our time to look through the menu until we were comfortable to order.\n\nI loved the volcano roll and found the miso soup to be one of the best I've had in Philadelphia (and as an Asian, miso soup tells a lot about the quality of what's to come). The waitresses did not hesitate to clear out trays when they were empty, and they always did so politely.\n\nWe lingered for a bit after finishing our food and the waitresses did not rush us although it was a a weekend night. I left a nice tip for good food and good service with good friends.",

The food is great, and the prices aren't that bad -- I have yet to find another place in Philly that comes close to the quality and the price.  I spent $60 for two and left stuffed.  True, places in Cherry Hill are cheaper, but I'm not about to go all the way there, and then spend $3 on tolls just to get back.\n\nSome people mention Koi (a sushi place down the street) as a better place, but I disagree.  Koi's rolls are very good, but much smaller and more expensive.  I spent $80 there for 2 and left hungry.\n\nOne thing about Hikari that I appreciate is they throw in some freebies because they appreciate the business.  Last time, they gave us two pieces of a maki version of \"ham and cheese sandwich\" -- uncooked salmon and cooked egg with cucumber wrapped in seaweed with rice on the outside to replace the bread.  It was clever and delicious.  I also recommend their udon.  It's the best in town, even better than my mom's.\n\nI really think more people should give this place a try.  For sure it's standard sushi, but I think you get your money's worth if you stick with the rolls.",
